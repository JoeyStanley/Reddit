An excerpt regarding the gaze: *The gaze should be large and broad. This is the twofold gaze "Perception and Sight". Perception is strong and sight weak.*  *In strategy it is important to see distant things as if they were close and to take a distanced view of close things. It is important in strategy to know the enemy's sword and not to be distracted by insignificant movements of his sword. You must study this. The gaze is the same for single combat and for large-scale combat.*  *It is necessary in strategy to be able to look to both sides without moving the eyeballs. You cannot master this ability quickly. Learn what is written here: use this gaze in everyday life and do not vary it whatever happens.*   Miyamoto Musashi's life is also amazingly interesting. Have a read, see what you think.

Because this is exactly the sort of boring, unwelcome diatribe that drives normal folks away from sports, Reddit and all kinds of other places where they shouldn't have to deal with this kind of soapbox-y bullshit. Please don't do this. I can't (and wouldnt *[sic]* ask you to) stop you from thinking whatever you like -- but only you can stop you from opening your damn fool mouth and making obnoxious comments like this. Seriously, it's not ok. No matter how you frame it, it's not "just your opinion", it's you inserting yourself annoyingly into a conversation and self-righteously demonizing both a fellow Redditor and a question thread about muscle tension. It's not a thread about what you personally find distasteful. That's called "being an asshole" and your juvenile horseshit stifles participation. If you're not someone's boring-ass soccer mom, this is inexcusable behavior and it's not ok. Knock it off.

11/01/2010	08:56:02	politics	tejmin	5	0	2b) If you've never flown I can't blame you for not knowing this. At 30k feet, where a plane travels, is beyond reception for cell phones. They go into signal search mode, and this crushes a battery. I've had phones that lasted over 3 months without charging on standby, in signalized areas. Those same phones, if you don't turn them off, or at least into airplane mode, they are nearly dead by the time you're done with the flight. And that's just a short, 2.5 hour flight.   This brings me to another point, if you're trying to use a phone as a detonator, and you put it into airplane mode to save battery, you aren't going to call that bitch cause it's radio is off. In other words, the radio that would be receiving a call, is off, to conserve battery.   2c) This is true, it's usually not. However, it's flight at 30k feet where reception is a problem. That's where the drain on the battery takes place - it may not kill the phone, but is that a risk you're willing to take if you're serious about this bomb going off?

Pasta is good for calories, but I'd recommend making your own or getting the whole wheat stuff.    Eggs are wonderful, Oats are cheap and filling.  Being into fitness, do some milk and get a large tub of protein powder.  If you have protein goals, this allows you to trim some meat out of the diet (not that protein powder is much cheaper per gram of protein...).  I recommend making your own tortillas and using them for misc stuff.  I'd use them instead of bread if you could.  Lettuce, tomatoes and a can of tuna makes a good wrap.    Also, potatoes are often viewed as evil and unhealthy, but they can be a healthy and cheap option.

Selecting the sample that way means they got the best supporters versus just about anybody for the deniers. They potentially set themselves up to prove their point.  When I say "not rigorous" I just mean that their sample selection methodology could have been better. That's all.

However, the helicopter is sitting on the ground, and thus ground effect is largely responsible for reversing the direction of air flow (at least close to the helicopter body) and lifting her skirt (oh my); when the helicopter is off the ground and thus ground effect is no longer present, airflow is much more consistently directed downwards.  Thus this photo really doesn't say much about the pros and cons of rotary-winged aircraft.

Of course, people would still be able to just sandbox if they want to.   You are correct in that this doesn't really add much to the gameplay overall at this point... it's mostly just a movement thing.  But, it is a great convenience to connect your world together, if it is spread out.  Biomes are the same thing... just a visual thing (that doesn't really excite me).  Hopefully some new gameplay elements will be introduced down the line.

11/02/2010	01:00:22	starcraft	pat965	3	0	Yeah, in that game Fake Boxer did have a lot of non-marine units, like tanks, marauders, and banshees.  My tests were flimsy, but I was with my friend in a unit test map, and for the most part I found that if you micro your marines (and my micro is not all that), I could take banelings on at a good 1:1 ratio or better. Banelings had speed upgrade, and my marines had stim, shields, and +1 (which is realistically what I would get as early as possible) On creep it was much tougher, and obviously these are ideal conditions (I know what's going on, I'm prepared, etc)  Combine that with this Marine/Raven strategy, and honestly I feel that if both players went pure banelings and pure marines, the games would be pretty close. The ravens are a decent deterrent to infestors, hydras, mutas, and even banelings, but even if you exclude them, cheap mass marine production is surprisingly pretty strong especially if you poke at the right time. I don't think pure marine would work very well if the zerg stays on 2 bases though, but I've never really seen pure baneling on 2 bases versus pure marine on 2 bases, so it's speculation.  Still, you're right, if 2 players (pro or amateur) went pure marine vs pure baneling, I wouldn't be surprised if the banelings rolled the marines hard. Even some of the variants of the raven/marine build involve siege tanks, and they're very effective. I guess all I meant was that I think mass marine play is still pretty amazing, and surprisingly robust against its supposed hard counters of baneling and infestor.

I've sort of been hoping a great anarchist programmer will see this problem and make a fork of reddit that is specifically anarchist and is moderated in a transparent way.  It could even have different "subreddits" for the different flavors of anarchism.  Until that happens, though, I think our sub needs to learn how to get along.

No matter how many there are (1W or 1GW) they don't have enough energy to affect atoms & molecules in our bodies.   Just for comparison, every photon the UV spectrum in sunlight that hits you carries over 4eV of energy, which has more than enough energy to screw with molecules. Which is why they say to use sunblock.  TL;DR - sunlight is way way way more dangerous than radio

Even if the pounds don't come off, I suppose at least I'll feel good about being in shape. And maybe someday, my ideal guy'll show up and surprise me.

Just be ready to make your point, I recommended talking out both sides of the conversation prior. Also, be very polite to the person you call. They are good people, who had nothing to do with the problem, be want to help. Third, you should know what you expect to get. You might get cashback, this would be the best case scenario, you might get vouchers or something. It's up to you to decide if that is what you want, if not argue your case for that in a polite manner.

11/02/2010	13:58:31	gamedev	blackstar9000	2	0	> Full disclosure: I didn't feel like reading any of that article, so I didn't.  If you're interested, the gist is this: Some games need a constant influx of levels to remain interesting, but procedural generation usually ends up feeling "wooden" after a while.  A possible solution for this is to create a level design "game," similar to *Farmville*, where the casual player is essentially making levels for a game that more hardcore gamers will actually play, with rewards for making levels that are good for playing.  > Anyone wanna help me make this game?  I'd be glad to help with some of the design aspects.  As a coder, I'm useless.  Here's what I'd suggest: Give it a social media angle.  People who complete another player's level get to vote on the level.  Then both players get a certain amount of points divvied out: *hero points* for the person who completed the level, *architect points* for the person who built it.  As architect's level up, they get to access to new tiles and pieces, and can build more interesting, more complex levels.  Oh, and make it look and play a bit like *Solstice*.

And I put up with it because I didn't think I deserved any better when it got bad.  I used to be a stripper.  Strippers don't get happy endings.  I was slowly conditioned to believe I was a horrible person who had some tiny, redeemable fragment deep inside that only my husband could see, and if I just listened to him, and submitted to him, eventually that tiny fragment would grow and I would become the person he always told me I could be, someone worthy of love, someone who did good things for other people, someone who wouldn't have to live the rest of her life ashamed of her past.

It would be like if someone made a dead baby joke, and you said that only an idiot would think it was a joke, because the tragedy of babies dying exists.

The government providing citizens with incomes increases the money in banks, which increases investment in the private sector, which increases the number of people employed in the private sector, which increases long term spending. War time spending when the economy is at full employment would be an example of the broken windows fallacy because government spending produces no improvements in other sectors of the economy; you would be racking up deficits with no subsequent increases in investment.

11/02/2010	23:31:29	australia	matjam	7	0	True story:-  In high school, one of the students in my year that I knew vaguely, committed suicide. It affected me deeply, not because I knew him, as I didn't, not well at least, but because I was suicidal myself and identified with him.   I had been teased and bullied mercilessly, and until I figured out a defence mechanism for it, I toyed with either going on a murderous rampage (with guns being hard to get a hold of, this was not that easy to do - probably a good thing in hindsight) or just ending it all.  Immediately after the aforementioned suicide, my year coordinator took me into her office and asked me, "Matjam, are you feeling suicidal? You'd tell me if you we're feeling that way, right? Come on, you can tell me".  Stunned, I sat there, and thought about how the hell I was going to get out of this.  I finally said, "Um, no, I'm fine. Can I go now?". She pressed a little then let me go.  I don't know what the solution is for teachers, but they need to get some better tools together to identify and help students than just asking them. Most suicidal people are not just gonna blurt out, actually yes I am, help me. Amirite?  Clamping down on bullies (teachers and students) more effectively would be a grand start.  ps, those of you still suffering through high school and want to know what the defence mechanism was? At least for me, it was laughing at the bully until he gave up and bullied someone else. It really wasn't that successful, come to think of it, but I'm still here, albeit scarred. All I can tell you is that your life now isn't what it'll be once you're an adult. When you're an adult, you get to choose who you have to spend time with; as a child you are forced into social situations with people who are just dicks. Not much you can do about it, unfortunately.

11/02/2010	23:45:19	relationships	YouBestBeTrollin	1	0	I'll agree with a) but I'm going to respectfully disagree with b). When you say bringing out the best in someone, I feel like you are treating your girlfriend like a parent would with their own kid.  Continually supporting your girlfriend is great but treating her with respect? I think you have that part wrong. I don't think you are respecting her by trying to control and change her way of life. She is after all not a child, she can make her own decisions whether it makes her life difficult or not.  If this doesn't mean anything to you I honestly don't know any other way I can put it to help you understand.

It just reeks of self-centeredness and total lack of any empathy or compassion, let alone ability to love or even just consider someone else's feelings.

You can extrapolate to a population of millions based on mere dozens of people, with proper statistical controls, and this is a lot more than dozens.

It also looks like I am the only person who will speak to you so.......... you know what? This is the last comment I will leave. Sorry, but you really need to sort out your priorities. You are probably going to think up some "really good" response, but it will never be vindicated. And if I never come back to his thread, in my mind, I have won. Have fun trying to start shit with other ents, but, like I said before, go die in a ditch.

11/03/2010	09:24:19	relationship_advice	leevs11	2	0	Two things:    Learn to flirt with the girls.  This doesn't contradict your chivalrous attitudes.  Actually look at your grandparents and their generation.  Very chivalrous, yet men knew how to flirt with a lady.  Think about how you would act toward a little sister or niece.  Tease them about something.  They love it.  This isn't being mean, it's just flirting.    You sound like you have some good standards.  Use that to your advantage.  This isn't about "getting girls" it's about them getting you.  Let them prove to you that you match their standards.  Tell them what they are even.  Basically be that man you talked about in the first half of the post.  If she wants to join you in your adventure, she better be cool enough to meet your standards.
