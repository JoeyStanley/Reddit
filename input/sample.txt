{"distinguished":null,"body":"It's an apocalyptic novel. Basically, it's sometime in the future - widespread desertification, water shortages, global warming, etc. There's a planet everyone thinks can support life. China's manned shuttle returns and within 48 hours the entire government has pulled out of the country for the new planet. Economy breaks down, panic, looting. The US realizes they need to head out too before the government is overthrown. They have limited space so there's a process of being selected for the shuttle. The story itself is through the eyes of three people.\n\nThat's it in a nutshell. I've never really done something like this but I'm excited. There's a bunch of details I obviously didn't hammer out but I guess I'll figure those out in the re-write.

I upgrade with every new release, but I could stick with this version for years, only upgrading my kernel and other bits as necessary.\r\n\r\nYou have your the core utilities (supplemented by slackpkg, sbopkg and src2pkg), a desktop environment/window manager of choice and software on top of that.  Some say the core utilities are long in the tooth, but that's what makes the platform possible.\r\n\r\nOf course you have to open it up to give people a choice of desktop environments (Slackware has KDE, XFCE, Fluxbox, blackbox, windowmaker, fvm2 and twm, and I compiled e17 in addition to openbox), but once you pick one you're basically there: core, graphical layer and software.  And KDE seems to be the DE of choice, as well as being the most automagical of the choices, so you could stick with that.\r\n\r\nI think it's basically because Slackware develops for stability and simplicity, ships the most vanilla packages I've ever seen, and has a DIY community that builds tools like src2pkg, slackbuilds and its sbopkg so that instead of needing a backport or an official package from the distro, you can just build what you need.\r\n\r\nYou also don't have all the problems introduced by featureitis, such as switching from straight gnome to an in-house unity desktop.  And because things are vanilla and the distro is built for a DIY kind of person (though you don't have to be to use it), all the tools are there and you run into fewer problems.\r\n\r\nIt has the reputation of being hard to configure, but that's outdated.  Between the new kernel abilities and the KDE4 or XFCE4 desktop, you don't need to configure anything to be running a complete desktop that is the equal of anything out there.  And I think it meets the platform model, because it's easy to upgrade anything from the kernel to your widgets while leaving the core utilities intact.","archived":true,"subreddit":"linux","author":"1369ic","distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1a","author_flair_css_class":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1288572992","downs":0,"name":"t1_c141fxc","parent_id":"t3_dz5n8"}

This, 1998, is of course the high point of the El Nino and this year's El Nino did not quite make the grade as high as the 98 one. The La Nina we are entering should drive temperatures down so as to track a declining temperature trend over the past 12 years.[here](http://climate4you.com/GlobalTemperatures.htm)\n\n\nSteve McIntyre : \n\"Making readers run the gauntlet of trying to guess the precise data sets\nand precise methodologies obviously makes it very difficult to achieve any\nassessment of the statistical properties. In order to test the GISS\nadjustments, I requested that GISS provide me with details on their\nadjustment code. They refused. Nevertheless, there are enough different\nversions of U.S. station data (USHCN raw, USHCN time-of-observation\nadjusted, USHCN adjusted, GHCN raw, GHCN adjusted) that one can compare GISS\nraw and GISS adjusted data to other versions to get some idea of what they\ndid.\"\n\"In the course of reviewing quality problems at various surface sites,\namong other things, I compared these different versions of station data,\nincluding a comparison of the Tucson weather station shown above to the\nGrand Canyon weather station, which is presumably less affected by urban\nproblems. This comparison demonstrated a very odd pattern discussed\nhere. The adjustments show that the trend in the problematic Tucson site\nwas reduced in the course of the adjustments, but they also showed that the\nGrand Canyon data was also adjusted, so that, instead of the 1930s being\nwarmer than the present as in the raw data, the 2000s were warmer than the\n1930s, with a sharp increase in the 2000s.\n\nFigure 6. Comparison of Tucson and Grand Canyon Versions\n\nNow some portion of the post-2000 jump in adjusted Grand Canyon values\nshown here is due to Hansen\u2019s Y2K error, but it only accounts for a 0.5 deg\nC jump after 2000 and does not explain why Grand Canyon values should have\nbeen adjusted so much. In this case, the adjustments are primarily at the\nUSHCN stage. The USHCN station history adjustments appear particularly\ntroublesome to me, not just here but at other sites (e.g. Orland CA). They\nend up making material changes to sites identified as \u201cgood\u201d sites and my\nimpression is that the USHCN adjustment procedures may be adjusting some of\nthe very \u201cbest\u201d sites (in terms of appearance and reported history) to\nbetter fit histories from sites that are clearly non-compliant with WMO\nstandards (e.g. Marysville, Tucson). There are some real and interesting\nstatistical issues with the USHCN station history adjustment procedure and\nit is ridiculous that the source code for these adjustments (and the\nsubsequent GISS adjustments \u2013 see bottom panel) is not available/\n\nClosing the circle: my original interest in GISS adjustment procedures\nwas not an abstract interest, but a specific interest in whether GISS\nadjustment procedures were equal to the challenge of \u201cfixing\u201d bad data. If\none views the above assessment as a type of limited software audit (limited\nby lack of access to source code and operating manuals), one can say firmly\nthat the GISS software had not only failed to pick up and correct fictitious\nsteps of up to 1 deg C, but that GISS actually introduced this error in the\ncourse of their programming.\"\n\n[images](http://www.surfacestations.org/ca/grand_12.gif)\n[and](http://www.surfacestations.org/ca/grand_15.gif)\n\nThis of course is just one instance where GISS has been caught engaging in this sort of nonsense....There have been many other examples  such as not applying  UHI corrections to a location with urban heating thereby making it appear to be a rural station and therefore the higher temperatures are \"PROOF\" of global warming.","subreddit":"science","author":"butch123","archived":true,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1288576580","author_flair_text":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","author_flair_css_class":null,"parent_id":"t1_c1413r0","name":"t1_c141mcu","downs":0}

You have the capability to travel to the ends of the universe, to live eternally in good health, and get this, to create life de novo. Now this creating life business isn't as easy as a snap of a finger, unlike cooking dinner in this distant future. In fact, this vivogenesis requires building the most elaborate Machine ever conceived.\n\nSo you and a team of engineers set out to construct this Machine. You place into this Machine-system 200 elemental raw building blocks. You write a programming language of sorts to govern this system, and also electro-chemical-physical laws to define how these elemental blocks can interact with each other. Needless to say, this machine is a bit more complex than your run-of-the-mill automated Higgs-boson synthesis machine. This machine and its products intimately interact, and do not exist as separate entities.\n\nYou've constructed your Machine, what now? The team wrote a program for generating this very specific life form, designated as project title namuH. You load the program into the Machine-system and let it run. Because you're basically immaculate at this point in your time and space since you're so advanced, you're absolutely confident your program is flawless and will create a perfect namuH, and it does. The program specifies that to generate the namuH, several byproducts must be formed. The initial phase of the synthesis process yields an intermediate that looks nothing like the namuH, in fact it's tiny, nanoscopically tiny. This tiny intermediate is further processed and developed into a multi-body lifeform, but it's still very far away from the namuH. A few lifeforms existing as functional \"organisms\" are developed, and exits the developmental pathway as quasi-stable byproducts. These byproducts, you've designed, will actually serve to sustain the namuH once it's formed. Finally after a month or two of running the program with many byproduct organisms accumulated, the first namuH becomes operational.\n\nYou and your dev team are stoked. During the 2 months of vivogenesis, your team wrote up a patch to address the exceedingly long production/manufacturing process--because eventually you'd like to mass produce the namuH. This patch basically enables a copy, merge, randomize, paste function to occur between two interacting flavors of namuHs or any byproducts to procreate new, unique lifeforms, thus bypassing running the original program from line 1 every time you wanted to produce a replacement lifeform. This update patch was not retro-compatible to certain byproducts, so they still function on the auto-regeneration program. One downside to this patch is that aberrations arise every time a lifeform is procreated on account of the randomization function; each individual is no longer perfect/free of mutation. However, your boss is still ecstatic you cut production time and manufacturing materials by several magnitudes of power.\n\nProject namuH was special, because the intention was to create a lifeform that is self-aware, capable of self-regeneration, and possesses the ability to learn, rationalize, create ideas, and express intelligence--features that none of the byproduct lifeforms possessed in whole. Years down the line, Project namuH and its Machine-system reached operational self-sustaining sufficiency. Indeed the intelligent namuHs learned to appreciate themselves, each other, and the Machine-system that so elegantly sustained them and produced them. Because you and your team developed an entirely different set of physical laws from your own to govern namuHs, you have a hard time communicating to these intelligent creatures. Yet, you've grown very fond of them and you love them nonetheless.\n\nLater on, your employer has decided to discontinue the project's funds. But since the system has become self-sufficient because of an excellent closed-system conservation of mass and energy, you and your team leave it running at no cost. You check in from time to time to see how your Humans are doing.","distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"ups":1,"score":1,"edited":false,"retrieved_on":1426546143,"score_hidden":false,"id":"c141twq","link_id":"t3_dz4nf"}

Stories about having their children taken away from them. Stories about going to jail or almost going to jail because of a false accusation. These are serious, serious issues that have hurt people deeply. Why is it so important to admonish them for it? Why not try to talk with them, reason with them - take the abuse they spew and show kindness in return - and figure out why they are so vitriolic?\n\n... are words I will practice taking to heart.

Well, that proves terrorism is superreal! Do you not feel scared? Watch a video of people jumping from the towers. If you feel terrorized now, it proves terrorism is superreal. If not, download a video of Osama that was found by pure luck in a random building in Afghanistan (God...err I mean the flying spaghetti monster, is on our side fellow intellectuals!), in which he tells us he was the superreal 911-doer, and if you feel scared now, well, that proves that terrorism is real, because you just got a little terrorized! If you still think terrorism is fake, look for some of the pictures of the dismembered corpses found on 9/11. If you feel kind of sick in your stomach, well, that feeling is caused by terrorism, and thus, as we scientists like to call it, we indirectly detected terrorism!

What sort of life you've lived has nothing to do with your capability to do that.\" It's not that easy, and a lot of the aggression that gets bottled inside from a confused childhood is often expressed through violent and self-destructive means. The child's mind doesn't know how to process complex and painful experiences, and those experiences and their accompanying emotions are almost always repressed, which in turn usually leads to acting out. There's always a complex, moving story behind why people are who they are, and why they do what they do. You never, ever know what it's like to be another person.

If a shark tried to use its nares while resting on the ocean floor, it would \"inhale\" sand rather than water. Many scientists believe this is one of the reasons sharks have spiracles. The spiny dogfish's spinal cord, rather than its brain, coordinates swimming, so spiny dogfish can continue to swim while sleeping.[48] It is also possible that sharks sleep in a manner similar to dolphins,[48] one cerebral hemisphere at a time, thus maintaining some consciousness and cerebral activity at all times.\n","link_id":"t3_dze0t","gilded":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","archived":true,"author":"thedarkhaze","id":"c142fby","parent_id":"t3_dze0t"}

Make a date of it, or go with a friend. Normal donations are over pretty quickly.\n\nI was donating blood regularly before I moved... still would if there was a closer facility to me. I also did platelets a few times, which was kind of weird... being that you have a tube in each arm and your blood is returned to your body after having platelets removed in a machine. It takes about an hour or so, depending on BP or whatever. They cover you in blankets and make you really comfortable with headphones and a dvd. It's not that bad... hands get a little cold from lower circulation but that's why you squeeze the little stress ball the OP mentioned.\n\nI first became interested in this because my father does it all the time (he's type o negative, I'm a positive). He has little plaques and certificates for having donated so much throughout his lifetime, but he doesn't even know/care where he put them. He was a medic in the Army... sure he understands how important these donations can be more than most of us."}

I've been extremely attracted to at least one guy who was half a foot shorter than me, and I'm 5'4.\n\nIt's hard to define what gets one's sexual motor going, or I guess, oiled. There's stuff that goes into it that demands some difficult examination of murky territory. I believe a lot of our sexuality is set in our childhoods and when we are older thinking about kids thinking about sex can be icky. I can remember having some very explicit fantasies when I was nine and the main themes that trampled through my head then still get me going now. Why do men like boobs?\n\nThere's two reasons I think I have a special fondness for tall men. Firstly; I'm short and I've been physically pushed around and threatened on and off. Having a big guy around who loves you and will protect you is reassuring. It also means he can protect children, which is not on my mind when I check out a guy, but it might be wired into me. I don't like that as evolutionary biological hard-wiring is often used to justify all sorts of stupid and demeaning theories about men and women. But there it is, just because I don't like it, doesn't mean there's nothing to it and I'm no expert.\n\nThe second is culture. Pick up a romance book and the hero is likely to be tall. Same with other genres. Tall is associated with success. And who doesn't want a successful lover? Again, this doesn't go through my head in any conscious way, but I figure I might be conditioned into it.\n\nOh and here's a third. Bonus! Culturally women are meant to be smaller than men, men bigger than women. Frankly that's stupid. It's unnecessary. But that's what we've been told and shown from an early age. Again, doesn't bother me when it comes to dudes I know, however it might be acting on your friend. even if she was smaller than the 5'7 guy, her libido may demand greater height difference.\n\nI hope this has been a bit helpful and not as scattered as I feel it is."}

No matter how you frame it, it's not \"just your opinion\", it's you inserting yourself annoyingly into a conversation and self-righteously demonizing both a fellow Redditor and a question thread about muscle tension. It's not a thread about what you personally find distasteful. That's called \"being an asshole\" and your juvenile horseshit stifles participation. If you're not someone's boring-ass soccer mom, this is inexcusable behavior and it's not ok.

And that's just a short, 2.5 hour flight. \n\nThis brings me to another point, if you're trying to use a phone as a detonator, and you put it into airplane mode to save battery, you aren't going to call that bitch cause it's radio is off. In other words, the radio that would be receiving a call, is off, to conserve battery. \n\n2c) This is true, it's usually not. However, it's flight at 30k feet where reception is a problem. That's where the drain on the battery takes place - it may not kill the phone, but is that a risk you're willing to take if you're serious about this bomb going off?","created_utc":"1288616162","score_hidden":false,"ups":5,"controversiality":0,"gilded":0,"link_id":"t3_dz74a","id":"c142v3c","author":"tejmin","parent_id":"t1_c142igd","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","archived":true}

The Congress will be transferring to the Obama Administration authority in a number of different areas over the lives of the American people and the businesses they own. The irony is that the Congress doesn\u2019t have any authority to legislate in most of those areas to begin with. I defy anyone to read the text of the U.S. Constitution and find any authority granted to the members of Congress to regulate health care.\n\nThe argument about Congressional authority simply boils down to differing interpretations of the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, which gives Congress the power \"to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states, and with the Indian tribes.\" Generally speaking, the Commerce clause is the go-to authority for Federal Government regulation. The modern legal \"test\" that a Commerce Clause-based regulation is known as \"Rational Basis.\" The rational basis review tests whether a governmental action is a reasonable means to an end that may be legitimately pursued by the government. This test requires that the governmental action be \u201crationally related\u201d to a \u201clegitimate\u201d government interest. Under this standard of review, the \u201clegitimate interest\u201d does not have to be the government\u2019s actual interest. Rather, if the court can merely hypothesize a \u201clegitimate\u201d interest served by the challenged action, it will withstand the rational basis review.\n\nIs the health of our nation not a \"legitimate government interest\"? Sleep on that.\n\nSpecifically regarding health care, the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel said in 1993 (with quotes from a 1940 Supreme Court decision - yes, 1940):\n\n&gt;&gt;Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel, 1993: The American health care industry is one of the largest and fastest growing segments of the American economy, and it has the most direct and crucial impact on the lives of all Americans. Spiralling health care costs and inequities in the provision of health care services have an immediate and massive effect on the national economy and thus upon interstate commerce. As a result Congress unquestionably possesses the power \"to deal directly and specifically\" with health care in order to obtain \"social, health [and] economic advantages\" for the American people.\n\nIs Connelly therefore wrong when he asserts that Congress lacks this power? No, but he's not \"right\" either. This is a question for the Supreme Court of the United States, not some hack Lionel Hutz from Louisiana. And the fact that he provides zero reasoning as to why his conclusion is correct is an obvious indication that he's just trolling you for notoriety. I truly hope that if/when a Supreme Court decision is ever passed on this issue, a Justice mentions in dicta that he hath defied Michael Connelly.\n\n&gt;This legislation also provides for access by the appointees of the Obama administration of all of your personal healthcare information...\n\nNo shit.\n\n&gt;...your personal financial information\n\nActually, that would be the IRS.\n\n&gt;...and the information of your employer, physician, and hospital. \n\nActually, that would be the Yellow Pages.\n\n&gt;All of this is a direct violation of the specific provisions of the 4th Amendment to the Constitution protecting against unreasonable searches and seizures. You can also forget about the right to privacy. That will have been legislated into oblivion regardless of what the 3rd and 4th Amendments may provide.\n\n&gt;&gt;Third Amendment: No Soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the Owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law.\n\n&gt;&gt;Fourth Amendment: The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\n\nPrivacy of medical history has nothing to do with either of these Amendments. If you require more explanation about this issue, please do not vote, drive, or run with scissors.\n\n&gt;If you decide not to have healthcare insurance or if you have private insurance that is not deemed \"acceptable\" to the \"Health Choices Administrator\" appointed by Obama there will be a tax imposed on you. It is called a \"tax\" instead of a fine because of the intent to avoid application of the due process clause of the 5th Amendment.\n\nThis is actually true, and does raise questions of Constitutionality. Note that I said Constitutionality, not fairness. Do not confuse the two. This isn't a matter of \"is the penalty reasonable?\" This isn't even a matter of \"does this tax even make sense?\" This is purely a matter of \"Can Congress levy a tax (like this)?\" It's a fundamental question and certainly not one that any layperson would ever contemplate or care about.\n\nThis is the mechanism in the bill to enforce the individual mandate requiring everyone to have insurance. A person who doesn\u2019t have insurance that meets minimum benefit standards (or other acceptable coverage, such as a plan that was grandfathered in) would pay a penalty of 2.5 percent of modified adjusted gross income for the year. The total penalty can\u2019t exceed a national average premium for individual coverage, or family coverage if applicable. But ask yourself this: if the goal of the overhaul is to provide affordable health care to damn near every single American, then why is this even relevant? The point is moot in theory and in practice.\n\n&gt;However, that doesn\u2019t work because since there is nothing in the law that allows you to contest or appeal the imposition of the tax, it is definitely depriving someone of property without the \"due process of law.\"\n\nTBD by the Supreme Court if necessary. Will have no real effect on any American's life or liberty beyond dorky Con Law implications.\n\n&gt;So, there are three of those pesky amendments that the far left hate so much out the original ten in the Bill of Rights that are effectively nullified by this law. \n\nOne Amendment (5th), actually. PS. It should be obvious by now that Connelly has a distinctly partisan outlook on life (\"pesky Amendments\")","created_utc":"1288620035","ups":1,"controversiality":0,"score_hidden":false,"gilded":0,"link_id":"t3_dzhrk","parent_id":"t3_dzhrk","author":"ajd6c8","id":"c14302a","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","archived":true}

Can these guys sense me or will they wander off eventually. Am I stuck burrowing for now?\n\nThe first pic is an unaltered screenshot. The second was brightened in Picasa. I'm looking into more info on the nature of Monitor/TV calibration (hardware and software) to see where we should really be. Please let me know how well you see both pics and what kind of Monitor/TV you're using and GPU/Driver version settings etc.\n\nI have an ATi Radeon HD 4650 connected to a Samsung LN52A650 52\" LCD HDTV via HDMI. I'm using Catalyst 10.10. Once I found the damn settings, I discovered the Pixel Format was set to RGB 4:4:4 (Full PC RGB). I used Calman Pattern Generator to make a full range grey scale pattern and made adjustments to the TV (not the video card).\n\nThis is how I found what can only be described as *night vision*...\n\nI knew that can't be right for my TV, so I switched to RGB 4:4:4 Limited Studio Levels and used Calman again this time generating a video levels grey scale pattern and readjusted my TV accordingly. Now my picture is not as dark as it once was, but I can still make out sand and water in the moonlight. I think it looks really great now, but the Nether still looks *dangerously* dark.\n\nWe need to find out how this game is *supposed* to look somehow. Between the game itself, Java, the OS, video cards/drivers a particular video signal is being generated. Once that has been identified, we can begin to properly adjust our monitors to display that signal correctly.\n\nI also found an item duping trick on accident using item boxes in single player... is this something that is well known?","ups":1,"score_hidden":false,"controversiality":0,"edited":true,"subreddit":"Minecraft","distinguished":null,"name":"t1_c1431sy","downs":0,"score":1,"author_flair_text":"","retrieved_on":1426546727,"author_flair_css_class":"spider"}

There's a misinterpretation here. Traditional NN arguments pinpoint the ISP as the culprit of denying delivery of content after *they* require the *content provider* to to pay *them* for delivery. \n\nThe idea is to prevent communications networks from controlling content that wishes to be delivered. The reasons for this vary, but the prevailing factor is that there are limited (if any) choices for consumers between providers, and there is often some level of public funding for infrastructure, which is part of the argument that it is a public communications network, though that is essentially what's being debated.\n\n*This* example is the exact opposite. ESPN is charging for delivery of their content.\n\nWhile it may eventually be added into the NN debate as another example of what damage can be done to consumers, with its own proposed solutions, this is not the same old problem, and I'll submit a reason why it shouldn't be considered a problem.\n\nWith my limited knowledge of how TV is regulated, it's perfectly acceptable for content providers to deny networks access to the content. It happened recently with Cablevision and FOX networks, which has since been worked out. Service providers pay certain content providers to deliver their private assets as a part of their service.\n\nFor an example on the Internet, it's legal for a content provider *(like if you own your own site)* to block access from any block of IP's for any reason. You're on a private network, and can make that private network as private as you want within legal limits, just like if you own land. You would probably want to do this in the case of a certain IP attacking you.\n\nWhat NN says is that it should be illegal for the larger network of Comcast/Cablevision, to deny throughput or charge throughput fees to deliver a content provider's content. I'm wary of further analogizing, but you might consider this your town not allowing you to leave your land, or the next town over not allowing you to pass through because of where you're from--perhaps without paying a fee.\n\nEDIT: clarity. \n\nEDIT3: removed the useless and confusing EDIT2.\n\n**TL;DR** - It's fucking complicated, and more every day you can't just clump up things as a blanket Net Neutrality issue and vote for Net Neutrality. Specifics need to be debated if anything is to be regulated without negative repercussions."}

If you were really determined to do any of these things, enough study and enough time devoted to the matter will allow you to do it. The idea that artists just sit down, bust out perfect art with no effort and continue on with their day is a falsehood.

Yes, there are people who have more of an inclination or ability to learn the material faster, but they _still have to practice and learn._\n\nYou could paint if you started doing it for 12 months each week. You could draw if you just sat down with a pencil, maybe read a few books, and started drawing. You could play an instrument if you struggled through that awkward first phase.\n\nYou need to select what you want to do and pursue it with vigor.

I ended up leaving my Masters program and getting a job in finance, on the cusp of technology and quantitative work.  I'm not complaining.\n\nThat said, for the purposes of getting a great (paying) job, math is fantastic.  It's applicable to a vast variety of fields and a Ph.D. will certainly get you through the door a lot quicker.  Arguably, a Master's degree is expensive and won't carry as much weight, but is still unquestionably better than a bachelor's degree (in terms of getting you through the door, not necessarily preparing you).\n\nYou should think about what you love to do.  If you go for an advanced degree in math, chances are you love math and will forego income for your love.  It will also be brutally difficult.  Not unlike \"studying\" chess, it is my opinion that you can only go so far on pure hard work in pure mathematics, and sometimes it might not be worth it (i.e. for simply the glory of a Ph.D.).

Of course the democratic process is presented as the one and only \u201csomething\u201d you can do. It's not. Additionally, what if the thing you take issue with is the process itself? Imposing one-size-fits-all solutions based on who can amass the biggest gang is not the only or best way for society to address problems.

We reject electoral politics, in theory and in practice, as incompatible with libertarian principles. Governments must cloak their actions in an aura of moral legitimacy in order to sustain their power, and political methods invariably strengthen that legitimacy. Voluntaryists seek instead to delegitimize the State through education, and we advocate withdrawal of the cooperation and tacit consent on which State power ultimately depends.\n\n-[Articles on non-voting @ voluntaryist.com](http://www.voluntaryist.com/nonvoting/index.html)\n\n&gt;Each year when election time rolls around, we are sternly reminded from all quarters that it is our \u201cduty\u201d to vote.

Two plus two equals four regardless of how many people vote that it equals five.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Individuals have rights which do not depend on the outcome of elections. Majorities of voters cannot vote away the rights of a single individual or groups of individuals.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Voting is implicitly a coercive act because it lends support to a compulsory government.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Voting reinforces the legitimacy of the state because the participation of the voters makes it appear that they approve of their government.\n\n-[Non-voting @ strike-the-root.com](http://www.strike-the-root.com/vote.html)\n\n&gt;When we place voting into the framework of politics, however, a major change occurs. When we express a preference politically, we do so precisely because we intend to bind others to our will. Political voting is the legal method we have adopted and extolled for obtaining monopolies of power. Political voting is nothing more than the assumption that might makes right. There is a presumption that any decision wanted by the majority of those expressing a preference must be desirable, and the inference even goes so far as to presume that anyone who differs from a majority view is wrong or possibly immoral.\n&gt;\n&gt;But history shows repeatedly the madness of crowds and the irrationality of majorities. The only conceivable merit relating to majority rule lies in the fact that if we obtain monopoly decisions by this process, we will coerce fewer persons than if we permit the minority to coerce the majority. But implicit in all political voting is the necessity to coerce some so that all are controlled. The direction taken by the control is academic. Control as a monopoly in the hands of the state is basic.\n&gt;\n&gt;In times such as these, it is incumbent upon free men to reexamine their most cherished, long-established beliefs. There is only one truly moral position for an honest person to take. He must refrain from coercing his fellows. This means that he should refuse to participate in the process by means of which some men obtain power over others. If you value your right to life, liberty, and property, then clearly there is every reason to refrain from participating in a process that is calculated to remove the life, liberty, or property from any other person. Voting is the method for obtaining legal power to coerce others.\n\n-[Abstain from Beans, by Robert LeFevre](http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig7/lefevre2.html)\n\n-[The Truth About Voting](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO9AtSwjV1s)","edited":false,"archived":true,"link_id":"t3_dzt81","score_hidden":false,"ups":3,"distinguished":null,"parent_id":"t3_dzt81","id":"c145rs4","gilded":0}

And attempting to hide that behind some prissy wording isn't helping.  \n\nThe only thing that I'm going to say about the Riemann hypothesis is that a whole bunch of people have written hundred of books based purely on the statement \"If god is real...\".  Some of the writing are quite interesting.  But even with all the raping and pillaging and good old fashion incest, should we really take these books as gospel and live our lives according to them?  We never deny that some nice results may follow should it be true, or at least for some people.  The rest get thrown into a fire, depending on who you listen to.  But really...if an all knowing being that created the universe actually exists, wouldn't the mere existence of the universe be considered as much proof as multiple million zeroes?  Or is it that you need a lot more proof before you can even begin to make that assumption?  If the Riemann hypothesis is so obvious to solve, why hasn't it been solved yet?  And when it is solved, won't it need a little more proof than just something you think is obvious?  If there was absolutely no proof for it, would you even have mentioned it?  Wouldn't it seem a little ridiculous to believe in something with absolutely no proof supporting it?\n\nShowing that a hypothesis does not have evidence to support it's claims, mathematical or otherwise, is not proving that it's false.  Especially when you change the wording of the problem, therefore changing the expected results.  That's called \"refining your hypothesis\", a very common tool in both science and mathematics.

This proposition has many benefits, ranging from fiscal to personal freedom.  Ending the prohibition of cannabis would generate extraordinary tax revenue for the state of California.  Also, legalizing cannabis would deal a major blow to drug cartels, as people would have a legitimate source for cannabis.  It also is extremely important to stress the lack of danger of cannabis.  It is a fact that nobody has ever died from cannabis, and the drug has many health benefits.  There are thousands of responsible adults who smoke cannabis and live successful, positive lives.  Proposition 19 passing would allow these adults to not live in fear.  If you have any questions whatsoever, please let me know and I would love to discuss them with you.  November 2, 2010 could become a historical date, and you could be a part of that.  Please vote yes on Proposition 19.\n\nThank you for your time."}

And you don't just let the person sit there while you look into it.\n\n4.  How is this icompetent?  If he left the driver alone while he investigated it, that would be incompetent.  A police officer doesn't break into a drug dealer's house and then wait patiently outside for him to come out, all the while giving the drug dealer time to flush his stash or grab a gun.  Now, I know the situation is different, but Police will always be cautious.  And you can't use argument that he's an accountant.\n\n5. Police brutality.  Again we only have half a story.  Some people will likely not agree that they were physically resisting a police officer.  Or will not see it that way. \n\n6. How would arrest/detaining somebody that could've potentialy stolen a car be false?  Arrest != charged.\n","archived":true,"edited":false,"link_id":"t3_dzlv5","created_utc":"1288669878","downs":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qh61","retrieved_on":1426548124,"score":3,"subreddit":"WTF","name":"t1_c14609t","author":"asoap","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"controversiality":0}

They were the kind of Christians who just accepted God as fact, but didn't feel the need to go to church or read the bible. They simply didn't think about that kind of stuff. I guess they were your typical suburban middle-class family. Eventually I came to atheism on my own, and when my mom found out (saw something I had written about atheism) she freaked out. It was the strangest thing, since we never really spoke about religion at all. We never spoke about it after that either, and when I see her now, she'll occasionally make a remark about God, but seems to have forgotten about my atheism.\n\nMy girlfriend, however, was raised atheist in China. Her family never talked about religion, but in a different way than mine. They accepted the non-existence of God as fact. When I talk to her about it, she tells me that God just never had any place in her world-view; just like you, she always thought of the existence of God as ludicrous.\n\nThe main difference between us is that I'm much more interested in atheism than she is. She doesn't like to talk about it, to debate it. She doesn't like to read Dawkins, Harris, or even Sagan. She doesn't like the \"new atheists\" (for lack of a better term), of which I consider myself a part of. While I can articulate exactly why I don't believe, she just says that she doesn't believe. That she can't believe, and that she doesn't need a reason to not believe. While I agree with that in part (one should need a reason to believe in something, not a reason not to), it's difficult because she's not interested in anything like that at all, and not interested in thinking about the implications of religion or atheism. It's like she thinks, \"why would we need to talk about it? It's obviously false, but if people want to believe it, there's no reason we should change their minds.\" She's a fatalist, where she accepts how things are and doesn't think anything should change.\n\nBasically, we believe the same thing, but arrived at it in and view it in two very different ways.","edited":false,"archived":true}

Banelings had speed upgrade, and my marines had stim, shields, and +1 (which is realistically what I would get as early as possible) On creep it was much tougher, and obviously these are ideal conditions (I know what's going on, I'm prepared, etc)\n\nCombine that with [this Marine/Raven strategy](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=163605), and honestly I feel that if both players went pure banelings and pure marines, the games would be pretty close. The ravens are a decent deterrent to infestors, hydras, mutas, and even banelings, but even if you exclude them, cheap mass marine production is surprisingly pretty strong especially if you poke at the right time. I don't think pure marine would work very well if the zerg stays on 2 bases though, but I've never really seen pure baneling on 2 bases versus pure marine on 2 bases, so it's speculation.\n\nStill, you're right, if 2 players (pro or amateur) went pure marine vs pure baneling, I wouldn't be surprised if the banelings rolled the marines hard. Even some of the variants of the raven/marine build involve siege tanks, and they're very effective. I guess all I meant was that I think mass marine play is still pretty amazing, and surprisingly robust against its supposed hard counters of baneling and infestor.","edited":false,"archived":true,"ups":3,"distinguished":null,"parent_id":"t1_c1466c7","gilded":0,"id":"c1468cl","score_hidden":false}

There is no reason for any educated adult to assume anarchism is violent or chaotic or dangerous in any way. It is understandable, however, that many, many people are continually indoctrinated to see anarchists as bomb-throwing, dagger-slinking assassins hell-bent on spreading terror and violent uproar for no logical reason. You have to ask yourself why this image is continually forced upon the masses when only a precursory understanding of what anarchist philosophy engenders shows it to be a system of mutual aid, democratic equality and political freedom, though.\n\nAnarchists are organized without authority. They are still organized. Anarchism comes from the Greek AnArchos- An: 'Without' Archos: 'Archons'. This in no way means violent chaos, upheaval, destruction, tyranny of suffering. Yet... how many media outlets continually enforce this false image?\n\nArchons are figures of authority. Archons are expressions of a system that uses authority to validate itself. So, what then, is authority?\n\nAuthority is violence, plain and simple. Authority is punishment if you don't do what you are ordered. Consider this; that the classical conservative philosophers of the US and the original political dissidents of Europe and Russia that formulated a working theory of Anarchy (beyond the Greek's origin) agreed on some very universal concepts: that the sole and total sum of the State was that it held the absolute monopoly over the use of violence in the geography it claimed control over.\n\nPonder that for a moment; every claim for legitimacy throughout human empire is predicated by and based upon the central theme of being the sole dispensary of violence throughout the region of rule. To simplify: authority is the force behind punishment; the validation of violence by the state or it's agents (regardless of what semantic gymnastics the organization attempts).\n\nSo then, what is the opposite of force? What is the opposite of violence and authority, the ability of authority to say 'Do as I command, or you will have violence visited upon you'. Whatever apologetics you might endeavour to excuse the particular idiosyncrasies of some manifestation of the state and authority you personally agree with, in the end the driving force of control falls upon the same rule: violence against those who will not obey.\n\nSo, what is it that Anarchism espouses, if we know that violence is certainly the foundation of authority and it's central tool? \n\nI know the answer, and I have faith that given time, you will too.","score":28,"retrieved_on":1426548391,"subreddit":"AskReddit","downs":0,"created_utc":"1288683106","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","controversiality":0,"name":"t1_c146ktk","author_flair_text":null,"author":"cat_mech","author_flair_css_class":null}

It's got this cool thing going on where you can look around, like one of those cameras that films fisheye video. It's a neat trick. It's some marketing thing for Doritos. (I don't get it either)\n\nThe actual game is pathetic.  The time restriction is stupid, you need to give an email address to play (it does allow bullshit addresses though), and it wants access to your mic an camera (but you can refuse).\n\nIt's divided up into 10 levels. The first three-ish are just clips. The 4th has you using a camera flash to kill a ghost. Your digital camera only has enough battery life for 7 flashes though. I failed it, but fortunately you can skip all the challenges if you so choose. The next has you playing a music box to keep a demon baby from waking up (seriously, does the possessed child thing scare anyone? I'm a *complete* pussy when it comes to this stuff, and *I* found all the scares in this laughable and predictable). I assume it uses the mic if you allow it. After that you have to leave the room without waking her up. This is a balancing puzzle; one of the ones with the bar that you keep the mark in the middle of the screen. There's a bit where the screen goes black and you have to find your photo. That part's pretty cute. Then there's more walking through the hotel. You take directions from some guy on a phone. It sounds like they had him record a bunch of different directions, but only ever use \"now go right\". Shadows kill you if you mess up. You run down a triangular staircase (buy Doritos!). It ends with you leaving the hotel and getting into the *ugliest* car I've ever seen and, in move so predictable even *I* called it, the ghost girl *is in the back seat!* And then she eats you or something.\n\nSo yeah, it would make for an interesting tech demo if not for the 6am to 6pm bullshit. It's nowhere near as bad as it could've been, but you shouldn't lose sleep over not bothering to play it between 6 and 6. And apparently Doritos wants to be associated with kidnapping people and feeding them to ghosts, or something.\n\nEDIT: Oh, I forgot. There's also a puzzle involving a keypad, red marks on a wall (which presumably are he code, but there are too many of them, so I have up) and a man in a straitjacket who eats you if you mess up.","edited":true,"archived":true,"id":"c146ucu","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"ups":2,"parent_id":"t3_dz5zq","score_hidden":false,"controversiality":0,"name":"t1_c146ucu","author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"S7evyn","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1426548514,"score":2,"subreddit":"WebGames","created_utc":"1288695267","downs":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qhoa"}

Plus when you have a easy to make back up you can feel free to experiment without having too eat something that tastes horrible if you mess up. \n\nOnce you've got down the regular way to make them you can start playing with them by adding ingredients that you think would taste good.

I'm not sure if you're looking into Permanent Residency (what I'm waiting for) or Citizenship--I believe to achieve citizenship, you have to live in Canada for 3-5 years (not sure which it is).  If you're planning to live in Quebec, you will have to pay TWICE for your application for PR to be assessed--once (about $500) to the federal government, and again (once the CIC gives you the go-aehead, and $250 more) to the Quebec government.  If you're applying from within Canada, don't plan to work for a year, at least, because you're going to be waiting that long for your application.  If she sponsors you, APPLY FROM OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY.  These have a higher priority because the sponsor and applicant are separated and (this is not phrased right because it makes them seem like they care) they want to put you back together.  Applications from inside the country take more time because they believe you're already in the country, why should they hurry?\n\nRead the CIC website, read forums, and read the Application Instructions MULTIPLE TIMES and make sure everything is right the first time.  It's irritating to fill it all out, get it ready to ship, and then have it sent back to you in a few weeks because something isn't done right.  If you have a question, call and ask MULTIPLE TIMES to ensure that someone is (most likely) giving you the right answer.  I marveled once when I called immigration multiple times in one day and got three different answers to the same question.  And every time, I asked if they were sure that they were giving the correct answer.  I've had someone who works for the government admit that half the people in the call centre will just say whatever they can to get you off the phone--oh, and the website is confusing and misleading on purpose.  \n\nAlso, if you're living in Quebec, please learn French (if you don't already know it).  It will earn you some respect.

If the square is D _ 8, and if its isomorphic to C _ 2 x C _ n, then n is 4, and C _ n is the number of reflections. But C _ 2 can't be the rotations because there are 4 rotations. So what could these C _ 2 and C _ n look like?\n\nIt helps if you think about the fact that one small rotation (i.e., the smallest non-trivial rotation) and just one of the reflections, *generate the whole group*!\n\nThe important thing is seeing that all of the other reflections can be expressed as a product of the first reflection, and some rotations.\n\nFor example, let's consider the square. Let's take as our \"basic\" reflection (call it `s`) the reflection through the line joining the midpoints of the top and bottom edges (i.e., a left-right flip). (And of course, our \"basic\" rotation is just a rotation through 90 degrees, call it `r`.)\n\nNow consider another reflection, such as the one you called a \"backslash\" reflection somewhere else. This is actually the same as doing our \"basic\" reflection, followed by the inverse of our rotation! i.e., this reflection = r^-1 * s. (Or \"s * r^-1 \", depending on which order you write your compositions in.)\n\nSimilarly, the \"forward slash\" reflection is the same as the basic reflection, followed by a rotation of 90 degrees.\n\nThis applies for *all* of the \"other\" reflections; they're all products of the basic reflection, and a power of the basic rotation.\n\nSo, really, you just need *one* reflection, and *one* rotation, and you can generate the whole of D_2n!\n\nSo, your *one* rotation obviously generates a group of C\\_n. And your *one* reflection generates a group of C\\_2. And every element of D_2n is either a rotation or a product of a rotation and a reflection, which lets us see that D\\_2n is isomorphic to C\\_2 X C\\_n.\n\n(P.S. This was way harder to explain than I thought it would be. If you think it's worthwhile please ask me to explain anything in more detail. :) )\n\n(EDIT: I don't know if this will help, but you could also look at the standard [group presentation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation_of_a_group) for the dihedral group:  D_2n = &amp;lt; r, s | r^n = 1, s^2 = 1, srs = r^-1 &amp;gt; , where `r` is the rotation through (2pi / n) radians, and `s` is a reflection.)\n","link_id":"t3_dklyy"}

It does bother me that he's trying to say he was misquoted, when there's video of him saying it, though. Either way, he's a comedian, so whatever. It shouldn't be a big deal. Moving on to my opinion of the joke's subject, if you don't care don't read it:\r\n\r\nThe problem is, there are piles of scientific evidence against this. \"Herp derp wimminz, they don't like sex\" is *just not funny*, and it's not true. It's an old trope that society has been trying to convince us of for centuries, while at the same time doing everything in its power to crush and restrain female sexuality. It's societal shame and pressures that keep women from freely indulging their desires, for the most part, with the added fun of hormonal birth control that totally screws up a lot of women and often causes the death of libido. But outside medications causing that has nothing to do with women just *naturally* not liking or wanting it.\r\n\r\nIf women don't like sex and treat it as \"the price they must pay\" for a relationship--why chastity belts? Why did people in the Middle Ages believe women to be sinful, lustful, seductive creatures who spent their time trying to drag down the noble, superiour, more naturally chaste men? How do groupies exist? How do bar sluts and sorority girls exist? Why do women cheat? Why did women consistently throughout history have sex before marriage and sleep around, even before birth control and even moreso since then? Yes, there's the whole Lesbian Bed Death issue, but I also know a whole lot of lesbian sluts. (And I say slut not as a term of shame, for the record.)\r\n\r\nI just get so sick of the whole thing. I'm tired of men (not all men, but the ones who really believe this is true) insisting that I, and every woman I know, are just exceptions, that *they* know what women are *really* like. I'm sorry, you don't. Yes, you've interacted with women, but you've never been inside our heads. My best friend, with whom I've knocked boots on many occasions when I was single, *still* refuses to believe that women can really just enjoy sex for sex, casually, without emotional ties. \r\n\r\nYou have no idea how often we fantasize, or the pressures upon us to stay pure. There are lots of people I would have theoretically slept with, but it wasn't worth it for other reasons, like what people would have thought. And it shows up in this subreddit all the time, the posters who loudly voice disgust at women who enjoy their freedom and then want to settle down when they're older, as if they're used up or lesser somehow. If a girl brings home another girl for her boyfriend, that's amazing, the best thing ever. If the man shares his woman with another man, he's pathetic, she's a whore, what the heck is wrong with them, how disgusting. The double standard still exists, even if it's not as bad as it has been in the past.\r\n\r\nAnd there *is* no biological reason for it, either. That's completely blown out of the water by science. Women are not choosier about who they let sleep with them because of biology--we're actually built for sperm competition, taking place *in* the woman, after multiple matings, just like our closest relatives the chimps and bonobos. It's society, purely society.\r\n\r\nAnd I'm not blaming men for this, either. Women are just as much to blame for slut-shaming as men are. It's society *as a whole*.

Wait times for your regular 'family' doctor are usually non-existant. I can typically have an appointment for my family doctor in the same day if it's urgent, or within a couple days if it's a non-emergency. These appointments are 100% covered, but some doctors charge extra if they need to do paperwork (like if you need a required physical w/ paperwork for a new job).\n\nService is priority-based, so the person who needs it the most will get it first. If it's life threatening, you're bumped to the top of the list. If it can wait then you're placed in a queue. The longest a family member has had to wait for surgery is about a month, my grandfather needed to get his gall bladder removed.\n\nIt's also based on age, anyone under 65 usually gets bumped ahead of the elderly for non-life threatening things like a cornea transplant. I had one towards the end of 2008, and being 18 at the time they found a donor and had me in surgery within 10 days.\n\nI'm not sure exactly how doctors or surgeons get paid, but I know it's a fairly decent amount - though I'm sure much less than the US system. Also depending on the size of their practice they may get paid a lot more. I've never had an experience with the US system, but I've never felt I received bad service here. I think they're also moving towards a more rewards-based system here, so the more people you treat or the healthier your patients are overall the more money you receive.\n\nI see the US system as a tad screw-y being profit-based, because doctors are essentially rewarded the more they turn patients away from procedures (this is my understanding of it). If you need a procedure or MAY need a procedure, here you're at least put on a list to have it done. And the Government is constantly looking for way to improve the system and service, they've started sending a lot of people to private clinics lately for MRIs or CAT scans if they can't get them into a hospital to do it - and they fully cover the bills. You also have the option of going private if you want something done immediately and you can usually submit that to your medical services plan for a refund.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention wait times for actual emergencies. Typically they're pretty low, I mean if you're bleeding out or having a heart attack you're going to get worked on instantly. I've broken my arm twice and I don't think I ever spent more than 3-4 hours in the hospital. When I broke my arm I went in and spent probably 30-45 minutes waiting and getting any forms done, went and got an x-ray, more waiting, saw doctor, more waiting, got a cast put on and sent home.","link_id":"t3_dzrnh","subreddit_id":"t5_2qzb6","downs":0,"created_utc":"1288714164","subreddit":"IAmA","score":3,"retrieved_on":1426548888,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"mikeyur","author_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t1_c147n9p","controversiality":0}

As a coder, I'm useless.\n\nHere's what I'd suggest: Give it a social media angle.  People who complete another player's level get to vote on the level.  Then both players get a certain amount of points divvied out: *hero points* for the person who completed the level, *architect points* for the person who built it.  As architect's level up, they get to access to new tiles and pieces, and can build more interesting, more complex levels.\n\nOh, and make it look and play a bit like *[Solstice](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2c/SolsticeNES.jpg)*.","parent_id":"t1_c147t4j","ups":2,"distinguished":null,"id":"c14845k","gilded":0,"score_hidden":false}

It would be nice to have this direct causation when discussing economics, but then the field wouldn't be called economics anymore really.  You are correct to imply that none of the items listed above explicitly preatin to labor, but they do create a \"system\" where capital is more advantageous than labor as the original poster stated.\r\n\r\n1.  Tax code:  Corporations get more tax breaks than they deserve.  The individuals owning a corporation get the benefit of the corporation tax breaks (transportation costs for operating a private company jet is a complete tax write off even though if used for personal leisure under the guise of business).  Individuals cannot write off transportation costs to get to/from work save a few exceptions which they should be able to do so.\r\n\r\n2.  Immigration Policy.  If the United States can prevent Saddam Hussien from advancing into Kuwait with 10,000 tanks half way around the world, are you seriously telling me they can't stop an unarmed, on foot illegal from crossing its own borders 0 miles away?  Obviously it can if it wanted to.  The US knows exactly what is is doing--cheap labor making its goods more competitive in the \"world economy.\" \r\n\r\n3.  Trade Policy.  Sure, let's set import quotes for cane-sugar such that we can bolster domestic production of.... corn?  Oh, but everything else is free game... save tobacco/coffee from Cuba.  Great policy.  It's illegal to import medicine from Canada into the US because the same company sells the same drug in Canada for significantly less than the US--and well, that's just not good for business.  So let laborers pay the higher costs.\r\n\r\n4. Organization of Labor.  How many union Wal-Mart's do you know about despite MULTIPLE attempts to unionize.  There is an obvious need to organize there since their collective bargaining power can finally provide some form of health-care.  Walmart has been able to fight them off umpteen times?  Something is fishy here IMO.\r\n\r\nAll of the above indirectly pertain to labor.  It's too complicated to fit in a post, and no matter how much research and evidence I provide retards like you will still exists... like the plague known as religion.","link_id":"t3_e03k8","score_hidden":false,"parent_id":"t1_c14881p","ups":4,"distinguished":null,"id":"c148d6f","gilded":0}

Here's what I think you can do that *might* encourage the appropriate behavior from him.\n\nThere are some women who really have men figured out. It's hard for me to even explain, but I know it when I see it. I could give you examples that you might be familiar with -- like Marilyn Monroe, or Jewel -- but I would worry that you might think I'm insisting that you be demure, and more demure than you're comfortable with. That's not really what I'm saying.\n\nSome women strike me as really being able to convey how much they like and appreciate having a *man* around. It's not even flirting, really -- it's something beyond flirting. When I was 25, I had a young girlfriend who was 19. She was headstrong. She was self-confident. She was a manager at a restaurant. She was very bright. But, you know what she did? She insisted when we were together that *I* drive. She just wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nI was working as a house painter at the time and driving a van. (It sucked.) She had an old, well-maintained BMW that her father gave her. When we would go out on a date, she would hand me the keys to her car. The first time I protested and said, \"Oh, no, you can drive.\" She looked at me and said, \"No. You drive.\" And that was it.\n\nA friend of the family has a wife. She's beautiful. I mean really beautiful. I've noticed this quality in her. I was at a party at their house, and she asked one of the other guys there to get a bowl down for her. (She's really short.) The guy got it, and she thanked him -- *expertly.* She smiled and said, \"Thank you. It's so good to have a tall man around.\"\n\nI'm telling you, that goes beyond flirting, but not in an inappropriate way. She had a way of conveying that men are a nice thing to have around -- even the men she wasn't sleeping with. And the effect on a man is *stupefying.*\n\nListen to some of the songs off of Jewel's first album. She's the same way. But, the thing is you don't have to be beautiful, or even all that pretty. Some women have really just hit on the idea of how to bring out masculinity -- that quality of *maleness* -- in men. They do it by appreciating it. They slow up, almost imperceptibly, when they come to a door, to allow the man to open it for them. They let the man drive. They put their hand on a man in a very feminine way when they speak to them.\n\nThey have a *thousand little ways,* and I wish I could only name off a dozen for you -- but I can't. And these are women of intelligence, with careers; women who don't take any shit. They just know how to relate to a man as a woman. They subtly encourage a man to make decisions and to take the lead. It's like ballroom dancing, writ large. Maybe dancing is a metaphor for romance. I don't know. I can't dance :-(\n\nI'm all for equality. But, we've thrown the baby out with the bathwater. There is great fun to be had from what almost amounts to role play. And I think there is something deep within the sexual creature in all of us that responds to this. Insist *he* decide what movie you're going to see, or where the two of you are going to eat.\n\nI hope someone out there can explain it to you better than I.","archived":true,"edited":false,"link_id":"t3_e013s"}

I had taken it the year before and, because I didn't take it seriously, I failed.  Worst feeling ever.  It was the hardest exam I have ever taken, without a doubt.  And I am really good at multiple choice exams.  Granted, I am still in my third year of law school and haven't taken the bar yet, but it was much more difficult than anything I have ever seen.\n\nYou need to study at least a full month for it, if not more.  Most courses recommend 2-3 months.  I used the PLI home study course, but I got a deal on it because a friend won a copy of it in a drawing.  Otherwise, it is not cheap.  I think any course, except maybe the cheap PatBar course, would do.  It is just a matter of forcing yourself to do the work.  I failed the first time because I just listened to the CDs on the subway going to work and took a couple of practice exams.  The second time around, I listened to every audio CD (twice), read the entire study section of my course (twice), and took every single exam question it came with (this is probably the most important part).  This took me an entire month spending a couple of hours a day studying, and buckling down and studying 4-5 hours a day the last couple of weeks before the exam (and this was after I already was familiar with the material from my last go-round).\n\nReading the MPEP (Manual of Patent Examining Procedure) is not a good idea.  There are a lot of chapters that are not tested on, and some material comes up way more than others.  The study courses guide you to which materials are tested most.  When you take the exam, you can search through PDFs of the MPEP to look answers up, but you want to avoid this, because there is not enough time.  You basically need to know about 75% of the questions without having to look stuff up, and then the rest you at least need to know which chapter to look in.\n\nI hope this helps.  Good luck!\n\nTL;DR Set aside a couple of months.","score":6,"retrieved_on":1426549296,"subreddit":"law","downs":0,"created_utc":"1288726515","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh9k","controversiality":0,"name":"t1_c148ipc","author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"rdunlap1"}

In general, you are entertaining, fun, and a great way to pass the time. But seriously, on this issue there are so many people whose brain just goes Derp! Its absolute insanity the comments people post supporting why they don't vote. I don't know if its lack of sleep but the ones here have just put me over the edge.\n\nSo now I am putting the entire onus of the election today on you Reddit. If Republicans take control of the house and senate today I will be blaming Reddit. Now this wont include those outside the US, those who voted, those who have no idea about politics, but rather the people who sit around here on Reddit mocking the system while simultaneously proclaiming that they are somehow smarter for having done so.\n\nIf I can have all of said people listen to me for just a second I just want to say one thing to you, Fuck You. Really, you are a major reason why the country is the way it is. You disseminate the culture of contempt, that voting is beneath you, that America is fucked up but its because there aren't more politicians like you, that every politician is exactly the same, that voting does nothing, that politicians have screwed over their base so they deserve what they get. Seriously, you are worse than even the most extreme groups of either party.\n\nWhy? Because humans are essentially herd animals. Its tough to accept the implications on our intelligence, but its true. The reason why the youth don't normally vote and the elderly do in droves and hence control policy, because one of these two groups has a culture that believes that voting matters and works at bringing out the vote. The more people that believe that voting doesn't matter the worse it gets. It is true that one vote doesn't mean much in the grand scheme of things, but going and voting does. By abstaining from voting you not only remove your vote, but you suck out enthusiasm from the system as a whole which over a short period of time can completely eliminate an entire demographic.\n\n\"Oh\", but you whine, \"both of the candidates are going to screw me in the ass, I'm not going to vote for either.\" Fine, go out and support a third party, getting on the ballot takes massive resources if you aren't an established party, generally getting a certain amount of votes makes requirements easier thus allowing those resources to go towards actually winning the election. As well, showing up and voting third party shows politicians that there is a disaffected group that is ripe for the picking if they change certain policies, look at the socialist party back in the early ninety's every single one of their party planks have been implemented without ever getting into the double digits.\n\nIf you don't vote, politicians won't give a fuck about you, tough but true. You aren't slyly refusing to give support to a system you dislike, instead you are lumped into the \"silent majority\" because obviously you are so content with the status quo that you can't even be bothered enough to vote. You just want to wait around for a politician that represents your interests, guess what? Its not going to happen. Politicians respond to the interests of those who might vote them out of office, they couldn't give a flying fuck about your interests if you don't vote.\n\nSo please, take the chip off your shoulder, the stick out of your ass, and your fingers off the keys and go out, sack up, and fucking vote you pansies. Because you aren't being smart by not voting, you are being incredibly fucking retarded.","edited":false,"archived":true,"id":"c148mm8","gilded":0,"ups":6,"distinguished":null,"parent_id":"t3_e0120","score_hidden":false}

Then you know what you want in return because you've weeded through the good and bad. I hope this makes sense. Be good (ie no nooses bro I've been there it's tempting) Suicide is worse than making a change even if you have to put up with other's denial/anger of your change, change in your demands, change in what you approve) You're too good to go, find and enlighten the people to that end.

This was an accounting trick and not an actual balanced budget. The national debt increased that year as well.

It's not the governments job to save money, it's supposed to save *US* money. This is why posing questions to the CBO can be misleading. The real question is not how much will the politicians save, so they can funnel money to other pet projects, but rather how much money will the total expenditure on healthcare be reduced by. The correct answer to this is there will be no decrease in the amount of healthcare expenditure. It will continue to rise, if for no other reason that the number of people in the country will contibue to rise. A true solution to the problem of healthcare is not who pays the bills, but rather to reduce the cost (i.e improve efficiency).","archived":true,"edited":false,"subreddit":"IAmA","score":-1,"retrieved_on":1426549758,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qzb6","created_utc":"1288741241","downs":0,"controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"aletoledo","author_flair_text":null,"name":"t1_c149idg"}

For a year or so we've been living hours apart see each other about as often and you and your guy. (We met in college, graduated, both moved home to different cities.) He also jokes around all the time and likes to, \"pick at\" me. Sometimes I get really frustrated and complain that his joking hurts my feelings or makes me feel like I don't really mean anything to him. When we first started dating, he seemed really \"standoffish\" and was hesitant to verbally express affection. \n\n We've been through some hard times and I must admit that I feel like I've been incredibly patient at times (also with issues related to *past* drug use) with him and questioned the value of our relationship. The difference between him and your guy is that when I expressed my concerns my boyfriend, he INSTANTLY got serious. Whenever I've brought up a real issue with our relationship he is all about what's wrong/how to fix it. He's also made a self-described conscious effort to be more verbally expressive. \n\nMy point is that I, like beertime and others, empathize with you. Your guys sounds a lot like my boyfriend except my boyfriend is FUCKING RAD. He intentionally goes out of his way to show that he does care about me...and that's why we're together now. If I sent him the text you just sent your guy, he would have responded immediately with a concerned call or text asking what had happened.\n\n I think its a general rule, guys will pursue something that they care about. If you don't feel that way, then as another general rule you should just gtfo. -- Obviously everything's not perfect for you. At 22 I would move on...or if its worth it to you, make a big effort to explain how you feel and weigh the results. \n\nOh and speaking of...jokes about your weight? Coke? No thanks. But that's just me. \n\nEDIT: While I was writing this, my bf sent me a text message: \"Whatcha doing, baby?

It affected me deeply, not because I knew him, as I didn't, not well at least, but because I was suicidal myself and identified with him. \n\nI had been teased and bullied mercilessly, and until I figured out a defence mechanism for it, I toyed with either going on a murderous rampage (with guns being hard to get a hold of, this was not that easy to do - probably a good thing in hindsight) or just ending it all.\n\nImmediately after the aforementioned suicide, my year coordinator took me into her office and asked me, \"Matjam, are you feeling suicidal? You'd tell me if you we're feeling that way, right? Come on, you can tell me\".\n\nStunned, I sat there, and thought about how the hell I was going to get out of this.\n\nI finally said, \"Um, no, I'm fine. Can I go now?\". She pressed a little then let me go.\n\nI don't know what the solution is for teachers, but they need to get some better tools together to identify and help students than just asking them. Most suicidal people are not just gonna blurt out, actually yes I am, help me. Amirite?\n\nClamping down on bullies (teachers and students) more effectively would be a grand start.\n\nps, those of you still suffering through high school and want to know what the defence mechanism was? At least for me, it was laughing at the bully until he gave up and bullied someone else. It really wasn't that successful, come to think of it, but I'm still here, albeit scarred. All I can tell you is that your life now isn't what it'll be once you're an adult. When you're an adult, you get to choose who you have to spend time with; as a child you are forced into social situations with people who are just dicks.

Don't be afraid of Flash of Light, It sucks up mana pretty fast, but can save you in a tight spot.  My most used spells are Beacon, Holy Shock, Holy Light, Word of Glory.  The only time I even notice a dent in my mana is if I had to go to Flash of Light for a Holy S*** moment.\n\nGet a jetpack for the gunship battle even though you probably won't use it.  I stand on the edge of the deck and can typically heal the people over on the other side just fine.  But I like to have the pack just in case.  Plus it's fun to jump around like a moron before the fight starts.\n\nWhen you fight Precious and Stinky (yes they are trash, but pretty strong trash) they will hit the group with a nasty decimate that reduces health to 15%, so try to position yourself where you can hit as many people as possible with Light of Dawn.\n\nThe first time I healed Dreamwalker I had trouble catching the green orbs inside the portals.  They are easier to catch if you pay attention to their movement and pause a moment near them, letting them hit you instead of you trying to fly through them.  Or maybe this is easy for everyone else and I just suck at flying.  Anyway If you start to one side of Dreamwalker, and fly in front of Dreamwalker in an arc to the other side of her you can usually get at least four or five each time in there, yet still wind up in a good position to throw out some emergency heals if needed to the raid (with Beacon always on Dreamwalker)\n\nIf you get to Sindragosa, try to have at least one instant cast available before getting sucked in with Icy Grip.  One or two people always seem to have a problem running out there, and having an instant heal available to throw while running is a lifesaver.  I also pretty much ignore Unchained Magic, unless we are three-healing and the other two clearly have the healing all covered.  It's better to take a bit of damage myself in a minute than risk letting someone drop.  \n\nI hope some of this is helpful!  I've had a bunch of fun in ICC and don't feel underpowered at all.

How dare you be so sober and well explicated!\n\nYour grasp of the economics of insurance is impressive but I suppose I should be more clear and expose my socialist roots. I see access to health care as a right and one that should be available to the public that funds it, just as the roads and the emergency services and military protection we enjoy are. And like those things I don't think it is fair to expect it as an industry to turn a profit or not be a draw on the economy. If we treated it as such, collected funding through the preexisting tax system, eliminated the money being lost to the insurance administration, we would accomplish the mixed pool we seek. But it requires us to view the whole idea of Health Care differently and accept that, yes, it is costly (but not as mucha s defense...)\n\nOn your second point, I would only urge those on the right to use this price oriented perspective on all of their policy decisions. I wonder how entangled in the Middle East we would be right now if that was the prism they viewed the situation through.\n\n&gt;In short you are perfectly right that the conservative agenda is to preserve the existing wealth and power (or more precisely the framework of existing wealth and power) on the basis that generations of effort (the same generations of progress you give progressives credit for) lead to said framework and it should not be frittered away by someone(s) who unable to actually create the wealth or accrue the power now proposes that they know best how to dispense it.\n\nThis... wow. I am not sure you could state it more perfectly. My only issue, and it is not with the premise but the players, is that I don't think the \"haves\" can see the difference, or perhaps even care about the difference, between knowing best how to use wealth and power and knowing best how to use it for the good of us all. I am not one of those \"they are standing on the shoulders of giants\" types but I do think the elite stand on our collective shoulders and should bare some responsibility for the rest of us, if for no other reason than to protect the consumers that make them rich :)","edited":false,"archived":true,"link_id":"t3_e08b4","created_utc":"1288764333","downs":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qzb6","retrieved_on":1426550427,"score":35,"subreddit":"IAmA","name":"t1_c14axzu","author":"rhoner","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"controversiality":0}

We generally look for a minimum P-value of .05 but ideally .01 before we reject the null hypothsis.\n\nOne thing that is very obvious in my dept. (&amp; when I hve asked ppl in other depts they feel the same) is that science has become very compartmentalised with everyone working on their tiny (but complex) part of the puzzle. There are people in my dept who essentially have the same job title as me, but would not be able to tell you why I do something one way rather than another or why I adjust the data in a particular way before analysing it (there are very good reasons and it actually makes the results more dependable than if you didn't). Of course when I come to publish my data they will send my paper to people who work on the same problems and will understand why I have done things that way. Alternatively they'll ask me to explain my reasoning and if I can't convince them... change my methods. This is the reason I would be very doubtful that just any physics student/prof would automatically know the whys and wherefores of a climate paper.\n\nThe idea that Hal Lewis would be 'better' qualified seems a bit presumptious. Yes, he has had a long career, but his knowledge of the basics stems from the 1930-40's and unless he has kept up with the latest work I find it hard to believe that he is more quailified than someone who has spent the last 30yrs of their life devoted to the subject!\n\nI for instance know enough to understand quite a bit of the papers, but I definitely wouldn't presume to understand all the reasoning for using a particular statistical adjustment or one technique over another. That's the reason we use peer-review!\n\nWhen it comes to 'the hockey stick graph' which was first publish back in 2001, more than twelve subsequent scientific papers using various statistical techniques and combinations of proxy records produced reconstructions broadly the same as the original hockey stick graphs. They vary in the extent to which the Medieval Warm Period and subsequent \"little ice age\" were significant, but almost all of them supported the IPCC conclusion that the warmest decade in 1000 years was probably that at the end of the 20th century. There have also been disputes about the use of Bristlecone and Foxtail Pine tree rings as temperature proxies \u2014 the National Research Council report recommends that \u201cstrip-bark\u201d samples be avoided for temperature reconstructions \u2013 but the same \"hockey stick\" graph is found in studies which do not use tree ring proxies. Basically, yes, the first study was flawed, but as it tends to, science has moved on and has found better techniques. Also, the reason the problem with the graph did not change the opinion of the IPCC was that although it was the easiest to understand by the lay person it was definitely not the lynch pin in the evidence. The evidence for warming comes from many different sources, laboratories and scientists from all over the globe....you can remove a number of pieces and still have the evidence stand as a whole.\n\nMy major problem with the majority of climate sceptics is that they spend all their time saying that 'the data isn't right' 'the technique they used was wrong' or just 'they are liars and frauds' but they very rarely provide their own analysis of the data or suggest what technique should be used to make it right (I have noticed the same thing with creationists &amp; evolution). This year the UK Met office has released all their climate data and along with the university as the center of 'climategate' so it will be interesting to see if any new research is published. There is plently of funding out their for anyone to do their own research (the oil industry would build you a house of gold if you could conclusively prove anything), if someone can prove that global warming truely isn't happening then I (&amp; I'm sure many others) will be very relieved! \n\nOf course there are always those that point to some sort of conspiracy to keep the real results hidden. There for me lies a real problem....to somehow get that number of scientists, from almost every industrialised nation in the world, to leave their morals at the door and deliberately mislead everyone about the results of their work seems unfeasible. Definitely a conspiracy of epic proportions! \n\nGenerally I try to use occam's razor in these situations and it seems to me to be that the simpler explanation is that the majority of climate scientists are trying to accurately describe their work and are not spending their time manipulating it for their own nefarious ends.\n\nP.s. I'm sure you know that google rankings mean nothing (although perhaps at best what is most controversial).\n\nEDIT: I have to say that for the most part my Dad has the same point of view as you (in that he believe money has influenced the results from the IPCC) &amp; I have said the same things to him.....I don't think he's likely to change his mind as he has said that it's just that it's more of a feeling he has and just doesn't 'believe' in global warming.","author_flair_text":null,"subreddit":"environment","edited":true,"created_utc":"1288777481","distinguished":null,"link_id":"t3_dzllz","downs":0,"retrieved_on":1426550627,"controversiality":0,"author":"naturalalchemy","archived":true,"author_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0}
