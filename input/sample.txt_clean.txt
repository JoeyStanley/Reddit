11/1/2010	2:44:33	hclpfan	Indeed. He was my high school QB and friend way back when as well. Glad to see he's back and playing well.
11/1/2010	6:3:10	logical	I didn't discover Rand until I was in my thirties and I can only imagine how much clearer, better and less confused in would have been if I had discovered her ten years earlier. Yes!  You should absolutely read Ayn Rand.

11/1/2010	11:6:35	eaturbrainz	Did you *read* that wiki page?  The following are B'tzelem's figures, quoted directly from your link:  Palestinian TOTAL: 1385  Palestinian combatants: 330/375*  Palestinian noncombatants: 762.  So, no, B'Tzelem is not claiming that 1300 civilian deaths occurred.  They claim that 762 civilian deaths occurred, and thanks to this new information we can now ratchet that number *down* another couple of hundred.

11/1/2010	17:6:2	ckwop	I ride 13 miles one way nearly every day. Not nearly as impressive but a word of caution to the poster.  If you're on a cheapo bike it'll really show quickly. Stuff will start breaking left, right and center.  My relatively cheap bike has had a new bottom bracket, two new wheels, a broken spoke, a new seat, a new chain, a single speed conversation (after a cracked rear cassette cog).  If I'd know all this upfront - I would have dropped some decent money on a ride that'd _not_ do a slow motion disintegration.   
11/1/2010	18:19:59	taniapdx	I get the sentiment behind this post, but can you imagine how many millions of times worse it will be if the Republicans pick up seats? Eventually Obama will come around and the dems will back change. With a very few exceptions, the Republicans want to see us back in the closet at best...dead at worst.

11/1/2010	22:1:39	kblam	Comics at least have artistic value, and can make statements on the human condition, satire, etc. Sports are "tough guy got the ball into that zone. Tough guy on other team got the ball into that zone. repeat, repeat, repeat, start over next season." Nothing of value to anything. "This team got *x* amount of points" means absolutely nothing in any scheme of things.
11/1/2010	23:15:23	bultra	I remember as a freshman in high school noticing incredibly similar symbols and patterns in an image of a Hindu deity (may have been Krishna or Vishnu) and the image of Christ in Revelations. Do you think these memes are prevalent because of the retelling of stories, because the symbolism is so finely tuned that they overlap different cultures, or something else?
11/2/2010	0:33:55	skookybird	Cool, but watch that kerning after you track (Im assuming) them letters up close.
11/2/2010	2:11:42	ilovebackne	if your anything like your writing style take this advice: a little less conversation, a little more action.

11/2/2010	23:51:49	impotent_rage	it's not so much that he asked for an abortion, as that he wasn't willing to support her through the depression she's suffering directly caused by her getting the abortion *he* wanted.  It just reeks of self-centeredness and total lack of any empathy or compassion, let alone ability to love or even just consider someone else's feelings.
11/3/2010	1:1:5	Patrick5555	I never said I used marijuana. Looks like there is an imbecile, but it is not me! hahahahahahaha, I merely respect the fact that prohibition of this substance is inherently wrong. It also looks like I am the only person who will speak to you so.......... you know what? This is the last comment I will leave. Sorry, but you really need to sort out your priorities. You are probably going to think up some "really good" response, but it will never be vindicated. And if I never come back to his thread, in my mind, I have won. Have fun trying to start shit with other ents, but, like I said before, go die in a ditch.

11/3/2010	8:23:35	Spazit	Delicious things from Australia, eh? I guess what we do best would be Vegemite and Tim Tams. Also Rocky Road.   I don't know if I can do a swap though... I'm a starving uni student, you see. Keep an eye out though, if I manage to get a job then I'll make a posting on /r/snackexchange begging for jerky. (Similarly, if you like the look of those goods, I know there is a few Aussies on snakexchange who would be willing to trade out some typical Aussie things.)
