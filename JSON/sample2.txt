It's got this cool thing going on where you can look around, like one of those cameras that films fisheye video. It's a neat trick. It's some marketing thing for Doritos. (I don't get it either)\n\nThe actual game is pathetic.  The time restriction is stupid, you need to give an email address to play (it does allow bullshit addresses though), and it wants access to your mic an camera (but you can refuse).\n\nIt's divided up into 10 levels. The first three-ish are just clips. The 4th has you using a camera flash to kill a ghost. Your digital camera only has enough battery life for 7 flashes though. I failed it, but fortunately you can skip all the challenges if you so choose. The next has you playing a music box to keep a demon baby from waking up (seriously, does the possessed child thing scare anyone? I'm a *complete* pussy when it comes to this stuff, and *I* found all the scares in this laughable and predictable). I assume it uses the mic if you allow it. After that you have to leave the room without waking her up. This is a balancing puzzle; one of the ones with the bar that you keep the mark in the middle of the screen. There's a bit where the screen goes black and you have to find your photo. That part's pretty cute. Then there's more walking through the hotel. You take directions from some guy on a phone. It sounds like they had him record a bunch of different directions, but only ever use \"now go right\". Shadows kill you if you mess up. You run down a triangular staircase (buy Doritos!). It ends with you leaving the hotel and getting into the *ugliest* car I've ever seen and, in move so predictable even *I* called it, the ghost girl *is in the back seat!* And then she eats you or something.\n\nSo yeah, it would make for an interesting tech demo if not for the 6am to 6pm bullshit. It's nowhere near as bad as it could've been, but you shouldn't lose sleep over not bothering to play it between 6 and 6. And apparently Doritos wants to be associated with kidnapping people and feeding them to ghosts, or something.\n\nEDIT: Oh, I forgot. There's also a puzzle involving a keypad, red marks on a wall (which presumably are he code, but there are too many of them, so I have up) and a man in a straitjacket who eats you if you mess up.","edited":true,"archived":true,"id":"c146ucu","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"ups":2,"parent_id":"t3_dz5zq","score_hidden":false,"controversiality":0,"name":"t1_c146ucu","author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"S7evyn","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1426548514,"score":2,"subreddit":"WebGames","created_utc":"1288695267","downs":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qhoa"}

Plus when you have a easy to make back up you can feel free to experiment without having too eat something that tastes horrible if you mess up. \n\nOnce you've got down the regular way to make them you can start playing with them by adding ingredients that you think would taste good.

I'm not sure if you're looking into Permanent Residency (what I'm waiting for) or Citizenship--I believe to achieve citizenship, you have to live in Canada for 3-5 years (not sure which it is).  If you're planning to live in Quebec, you will have to pay TWICE for your application for PR to be assessed--once (about $500) to the federal government, and again (once the CIC gives you the go-aehead, and $250 more) to the Quebec government.  If you're applying from within Canada, don't plan to work for a year, at least, because you're going to be waiting that long for your application.  If she sponsors you, APPLY FROM OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY.  These have a higher priority because the sponsor and applicant are separated and (this is not phrased right because it makes them seem like they care) they want to put you back together.  Applications from inside the country take more time because they believe you're already in the country, why should they hurry?\n\nRead the CIC website, read forums, and read the Application Instructions MULTIPLE TIMES and make sure everything is right the first time.  It's irritating to fill it all out, get it ready to ship, and then have it sent back to you in a few weeks because something isn't done right.  If you have a question, call and ask MULTIPLE TIMES to ensure that someone is (most likely) giving you the right answer.  I marveled once when I called immigration multiple times in one day and got three different answers to the same question.  And every time, I asked if they were sure that they were giving the correct answer.  I've had someone who works for the government admit that half the people in the call centre will just say whatever they can to get you off the phone--oh, and the website is confusing and misleading on purpose.  \n\nAlso, if you're living in Quebec, please learn French (if you don't already know it).  It will earn you some respect.

If the square is D _ 8, and if its isomorphic to C _ 2 x C _ n, then n is 4, and C _ n is the number of reflections. But C _ 2 can't be the rotations because there are 4 rotations. So what could these C _ 2 and C _ n look like?\n\nIt helps if you think about the fact that one small rotation (i.e., the smallest non-trivial rotation) and just one of the reflections, *generate the whole group*!\n\nThe important thing is seeing that all of the other reflections can be expressed as a product of the first reflection, and some rotations.\n\nFor example, let's consider the square. Let's take as our \"basic\" reflection (call it `s`) the reflection through the line joining the midpoints of the top and bottom edges (i.e., a left-right flip). (And of course, our \"basic\" rotation is just a rotation through 90 degrees, call it `r`.)\n\nNow consider another reflection, such as the one you called a \"backslash\" reflection somewhere else. This is actually the same as doing our \"basic\" reflection, followed by the inverse of our rotation! i.e., this reflection = r^-1 * s. (Or \"s * r^-1 \", depending on which order you write your compositions in.)\n\nSimilarly, the \"forward slash\" reflection is the same as the basic reflection, followed by a rotation of 90 degrees.\n\nThis applies for *all* of the \"other\" reflections; they're all products of the basic reflection, and a power of the basic rotation.\n\nSo, really, you just need *one* reflection, and *one* rotation, and you can generate the whole of D_2n!\n\nSo, your *one* rotation obviously generates a group of C\\_n. And your *one* reflection generates a group of C\\_2. And every element of D_2n is either a rotation or a product of a rotation and a reflection, which lets us see that D\\_2n is isomorphic to C\\_2 X C\\_n.\n\n(P.S. This was way harder to explain than I thought it would be. If you think it's worthwhile please ask me to explain anything in more detail. :) )\n\n(EDIT: I don't know if this will help, but you could also look at the standard [group presentation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation_of_a_group) for the dihedral group:  D_2n = &amp;lt; r, s | r^n = 1, s^2 = 1, srs = r^-1 &amp;gt; , where `r` is the rotation through (2pi / n) radians, and `s` is a reflection.)\n","link_id":"t3_dklyy"}

It does bother me that he's trying to say he was misquoted, when there's video of him saying it, though. Either way, he's a comedian, so whatever. It shouldn't be a big deal. Moving on to my opinion of the joke's subject, if you don't care don't read it:\r\n\r\nThe problem is, there are piles of scientific evidence against this. \"Herp derp wimminz, they don't like sex\" is *just not funny*, and it's not true. It's an old trope that society has been trying to convince us of for centuries, while at the same time doing everything in its power to crush and restrain female sexuality. It's societal shame and pressures that keep women from freely indulging their desires, for the most part, with the added fun of hormonal birth control that totally screws up a lot of women and often causes the death of libido. But outside medications causing that has nothing to do with women just *naturally* not liking or wanting it.\r\n\r\nIf women don't like sex and treat it as \"the price they must pay\" for a relationship--why chastity belts? Why did people in the Middle Ages believe women to be sinful, lustful, seductive creatures who spent their time trying to drag down the noble, superiour, more naturally chaste men? How do groupies exist? How do bar sluts and sorority girls exist? Why do women cheat? Why did women consistently throughout history have sex before marriage and sleep around, even before birth control and even moreso since then? Yes, there's the whole Lesbian Bed Death issue, but I also know a whole lot of lesbian sluts. (And I say slut not as a term of shame, for the record.)\r\n\r\nI just get so sick of the whole thing. I'm tired of men (not all men, but the ones who really believe this is true) insisting that I, and every woman I know, are just exceptions, that *they* know what women are *really* like. I'm sorry, you don't. Yes, you've interacted with women, but you've never been inside our heads. My best friend, with whom I've knocked boots on many occasions when I was single, *still* refuses to believe that women can really just enjoy sex for sex, casually, without emotional ties. \r\n\r\nYou have no idea how often we fantasize, or the pressures upon us to stay pure. There are lots of people I would have theoretically slept with, but it wasn't worth it for other reasons, like what people would have thought. And it shows up in this subreddit all the time, the posters who loudly voice disgust at women who enjoy their freedom and then want to settle down when they're older, as if they're used up or lesser somehow. If a girl brings home another girl for her boyfriend, that's amazing, the best thing ever. If the man shares his woman with another man, he's pathetic, she's a whore, what the heck is wrong with them, how disgusting. The double standard still exists, even if it's not as bad as it has been in the past.\r\n\r\nAnd there *is* no biological reason for it, either. That's completely blown out of the water by science. Women are not choosier about who they let sleep with them because of biology--we're actually built for sperm competition, taking place *in* the woman, after multiple matings, just like our closest relatives the chimps and bonobos. It's society, purely society.\r\n\r\nAnd I'm not blaming men for this, either. Women are just as much to blame for slut-shaming as men are. It's society *as a whole*.

Worst case, mom would try to work her manipulation on my wife, thinking they could get through to me that way. I can say \"no\" to my mother, because I learned the consequences of saying \"yes\" when looking at my parents. My dad took his mother's side against my mom a lot when I was growing up.

Wait times for your regular 'family' doctor are usually non-existant. I can typically have an appointment for my family doctor in the same day if it's urgent, or within a couple days if it's a non-emergency. These appointments are 100% covered, but some doctors charge extra if they need to do paperwork (like if you need a required physical w/ paperwork for a new job).\n\nService is priority-based, so the person who needs it the most will get it first. If it's life threatening, you're bumped to the top of the list. If it can wait then you're placed in a queue. The longest a family member has had to wait for surgery is about a month, my grandfather needed to get his gall bladder removed.\n\nIt's also based on age, anyone under 65 usually gets bumped ahead of the elderly for non-life threatening things like a cornea transplant. I had one towards the end of 2008, and being 18 at the time they found a donor and had me in surgery within 10 days.\n\nI'm not sure exactly how doctors or surgeons get paid, but I know it's a fairly decent amount - though I'm sure much less than the US system. Also depending on the size of their practice they may get paid a lot more. I've never had an experience with the US system, but I've never felt I received bad service here. I think they're also moving towards a more rewards-based system here, so the more people you treat or the healthier your patients are overall the more money you receive.\n\nI see the US system as a tad screw-y being profit-based, because doctors are essentially rewarded the more they turn patients away from procedures (this is my understanding of it). If you need a procedure or MAY need a procedure, here you're at least put on a list to have it done. And the Government is constantly looking for way to improve the system and service, they've started sending a lot of people to private clinics lately for MRIs or CAT scans if they can't get them into a hospital to do it - and they fully cover the bills. You also have the option of going private if you want something done immediately and you can usually submit that to your medical services plan for a refund.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention wait times for actual emergencies. Typically they're pretty low, I mean if you're bleeding out or having a heart attack you're going to get worked on instantly. I've broken my arm twice and I don't think I ever spent more than 3-4 hours in the hospital. When I broke my arm I went in and spent probably 30-45 minutes waiting and getting any forms done, went and got an x-ray, more waiting, saw doctor, more waiting, got a cast put on and sent home.","link_id":"t3_dzrnh","subreddit_id":"t5_2qzb6","downs":0,"created_utc":"1288714164","subreddit":"IAmA","score":3,"retrieved_on":1426548888,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"mikeyur","author_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t1_c147n9p","controversiality":0}

You can't make companies insure sick people and mandate higher benefits without making insurance more expensive.\n\nThis is my favorite one, and best argument in favor of Obamacare. It prevents companies from dropping sick people, who've paid their insurance. And the mandate brings more business to the insurance companies, which lowers costs. Additionally, it does this while [lowering the deficit by $138 billion](http://www.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/03/18/health.care.main/index.html?hpt=T1) over the next ten years.\n\n&gt; Second, it reduces competition, including the most important competition, the right to just say no.\n\nThankfully it doesn't do this at all, since the same companies still exist, and are still competing, and are still privately owned.

It would be nice to have this direct causation when discussing economics, but then the field wouldn't be called economics anymore really.  You are correct to imply that none of the items listed above explicitly preatin to labor, but they do create a \"system\" where capital is more advantageous than labor as the original poster stated.\r\n\r\n1.  Tax code:  Corporations get more tax breaks than they deserve.  The individuals owning a corporation get the benefit of the corporation tax breaks (transportation costs for operating a private company jet is a complete tax write off even though if used for personal leisure under the guise of business).  Individuals cannot write off transportation costs to get to/from work save a few exceptions which they should be able to do so.\r\n\r\n2.  Immigration Policy.  If the United States can prevent Saddam Hussien from advancing into Kuwait with 10,000 tanks half way around the world, are you seriously telling me they can't stop an unarmed, on foot illegal from crossing its own borders 0 miles away?  Obviously it can if it wanted to.  The US knows exactly what is is doing--cheap labor making its goods more competitive in the \"world economy.\" \r\n\r\n3.  Trade Policy.  Sure, let's set import quotes for cane-sugar such that we can bolster domestic production of.... corn?  Oh, but everything else is free game... save tobacco/coffee from Cuba.  Great policy.  It's illegal to import medicine from Canada into the US because the same company sells the same drug in Canada for significantly less than the US--and well, that's just not good for business.  So let laborers pay the higher costs.\r\n\r\n4. Organization of Labor.  How many union Wal-Mart's do you know about despite MULTIPLE attempts to unionize.  There is an obvious need to organize there since their collective bargaining power can finally provide some form of health-care.  Walmart has been able to fight them off umpteen times?  Something is fishy here IMO.\r\n\r\nAll of the above indirectly pertain to labor.  It's too complicated to fit in a post, and no matter how much research and evidence I provide retards like you will still exists... like the plague known as religion.","link_id":"t3_e03k8","score_hidden":false,"parent_id":"t1_c14881p","ups":4,"distinguished":null,"id":"c148d6f","gilded":0}

Here's what I think you can do that *might* encourage the appropriate behavior from him.\n\nThere are some women who really have men figured out. It's hard for me to even explain, but I know it when I see it. I could give you examples that you might be familiar with -- like Marilyn Monroe, or Jewel -- but I would worry that you might think I'm insisting that you be demure, and more demure than you're comfortable with. That's not really what I'm saying.\n\nSome women strike me as really being able to convey how much they like and appreciate having a *man* around. It's not even flirting, really -- it's something beyond flirting. When I was 25, I had a young girlfriend who was 19. She was headstrong. She was self-confident. She was a manager at a restaurant. She was very bright. But, you know what she did? She insisted when we were together that *I* drive. She just wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nI was working as a house painter at the time and driving a van. (It sucked.) She had an old, well-maintained BMW that her father gave her. When we would go out on a date, she would hand me the keys to her car. The first time I protested and said, \"Oh, no, you can drive.\" She looked at me and said, \"No. You drive.\" And that was it.\n\nA friend of the family has a wife. She's beautiful. I mean really beautiful. I've noticed this quality in her. I was at a party at their house, and she asked one of the other guys there to get a bowl down for her. (She's really short.) The guy got it, and she thanked him -- *expertly.* She smiled and said, \"Thank you. It's so good to have a tall man around.\"\n\nI'm telling you, that goes beyond flirting, but not in an inappropriate way. She had a way of conveying that men are a nice thing to have around -- even the men she wasn't sleeping with. And the effect on a man is *stupefying.*\n\nListen to some of the songs off of Jewel's first album. She's the same way. But, the thing is you don't have to be beautiful, or even all that pretty. Some women have really just hit on the idea of how to bring out masculinity -- that quality of *maleness* -- in men. They do it by appreciating it. They slow up, almost imperceptibly, when they come to a door, to allow the man to open it for them. They let the man drive. They put their hand on a man in a very feminine way when they speak to them.\n\nThey have a *thousand little ways,* and I wish I could only name off a dozen for you -- but I can't. And these are women of intelligence, with careers; women who don't take any shit. They just know how to relate to a man as a woman. They subtly encourage a man to make decisions and to take the lead. It's like ballroom dancing, writ large. Maybe dancing is a metaphor for romance. I don't know. I can't dance :-(\n\nI'm all for equality. But, we've thrown the baby out with the bathwater. There is great fun to be had from what almost amounts to role play. And I think there is something deep within the sexual creature in all of us that responds to this. Insist *he* decide what movie you're going to see, or where the two of you are going to eat.\n\nI hope someone out there can explain it to you better than I.","archived":true,"edited":false,"link_id":"t3_e013s"}

I had taken it the year before and, because I didn't take it seriously, I failed.  Worst feeling ever.  It was the hardest exam I have ever taken, without a doubt.  And I am really good at multiple choice exams.  Granted, I am still in my third year of law school and haven't taken the bar yet, but it was much more difficult than anything I have ever seen.\n\nYou need to study at least a full month for it, if not more.  Most courses recommend 2-3 months.  I used the PLI home study course, but I got a deal on it because a friend won a copy of it in a drawing.  Otherwise, it is not cheap.  I think any course, except maybe the cheap PatBar course, would do.  It is just a matter of forcing yourself to do the work.  I failed the first time because I just listened to the CDs on the subway going to work and took a couple of practice exams.  The second time around, I listened to every audio CD (twice), read the entire study section of my course (twice), and took every single exam question it came with (this is probably the most important part).  This took me an entire month spending a couple of hours a day studying, and buckling down and studying 4-5 hours a day the last couple of weeks before the exam (and this was after I already was familiar with the material from my last go-round).\n\nReading the MPEP (Manual of Patent Examining Procedure) is not a good idea.  There are a lot of chapters that are not tested on, and some material comes up way more than others.  The study courses guide you to which materials are tested most.  When you take the exam, you can search through PDFs of the MPEP to look answers up, but you want to avoid this, because there is not enough time.  You basically need to know about 75% of the questions without having to look stuff up, and then the rest you at least need to know which chapter to look in.\n\nI hope this helps.  Good luck!\n\nTL;DR Set aside a couple of months.","score":6,"retrieved_on":1426549296,"subreddit":"law","downs":0,"created_utc":"1288726515","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh9k","controversiality":0,"name":"t1_c148ipc","author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"rdunlap1"}

In general, you are entertaining, fun, and a great way to pass the time. But seriously, on this issue there are so many people whose brain just goes Derp! Its absolute insanity the comments people post supporting why they don't vote. I don't know if its lack of sleep but the ones here have just put me over the edge.\n\nSo now I am putting the entire onus of the election today on you Reddit. If Republicans take control of the house and senate today I will be blaming Reddit. Now this wont include those outside the US, those who voted, those who have no idea about politics, but rather the people who sit around here on Reddit mocking the system while simultaneously proclaiming that they are somehow smarter for having done so.\n\nIf I can have all of said people listen to me for just a second I just want to say one thing to you, Fuck You. Really, you are a major reason why the country is the way it is. You disseminate the culture of contempt, that voting is beneath you, that America is fucked up but its because there aren't more politicians like you, that every politician is exactly the same, that voting does nothing, that politicians have screwed over their base so they deserve what they get. Seriously, you are worse than even the most extreme groups of either party.\n\nWhy? Because humans are essentially herd animals. Its tough to accept the implications on our intelligence, but its true. The reason why the youth don't normally vote and the elderly do in droves and hence control policy, because one of these two groups has a culture that believes that voting matters and works at bringing out the vote. The more people that believe that voting doesn't matter the worse it gets. It is true that one vote doesn't mean much in the grand scheme of things, but going and voting does. By abstaining from voting you not only remove your vote, but you suck out enthusiasm from the system as a whole which over a short period of time can completely eliminate an entire demographic.\n\n\"Oh\", but you whine, \"both of the candidates are going to screw me in the ass, I'm not going to vote for either.\" Fine, go out and support a third party, getting on the ballot takes massive resources if you aren't an established party, generally getting a certain amount of votes makes requirements easier thus allowing those resources to go towards actually winning the election. As well, showing up and voting third party shows politicians that there is a disaffected group that is ripe for the picking if they change certain policies, look at the socialist party back in the early ninety's every single one of their party planks have been implemented without ever getting into the double digits.\n\nIf you don't vote, politicians won't give a fuck about you, tough but true. You aren't slyly refusing to give support to a system you dislike, instead you are lumped into the \"silent majority\" because obviously you are so content with the status quo that you can't even be bothered enough to vote. You just want to wait around for a politician that represents your interests, guess what? Its not going to happen. Politicians respond to the interests of those who might vote them out of office, they couldn't give a flying fuck about your interests if you don't vote.\n\nSo please, take the chip off your shoulder, the stick out of your ass, and your fingers off the keys and go out, sack up, and fucking vote you pansies. Because you aren't being smart by not voting, you are being incredibly fucking retarded.","edited":false,"archived":true,"id":"c148mm8","gilded":0,"ups":6,"distinguished":null,"parent_id":"t3_e0120","score_hidden":false}

In the early game, its stats are very good, it has a 98% guaranteed Sleep Powder (only Spore, which is available to a grand total of three pokemon and only significantly later-game, is more reliable), and it has decent Psychic and Flying attacks.\n\nIn later game, though, evolved pokemon generally have much better stats, and better moves other than just Bug/Psychic attacks, and one kinda meh flying TM move."}

Now, if you're an old school Republican who simply favors smaller government and believes that government isn't the answer to most problems, I think those are debatable principles and arguing from those positions on the various topics that appear here might be dealt with more kindly.

This was an accounting trick and not an actual balanced budget. The national debt increased that year as well.

It's not the governments job to save money, it's supposed to save *US* money. This is why posing questions to the CBO can be misleading. The real question is not how much will the politicians save, so they can funnel money to other pet projects, but rather how much money will the total expenditure on healthcare be reduced by. The correct answer to this is there will be no decrease in the amount of healthcare expenditure. It will continue to rise, if for no other reason that the number of people in the country will contibue to rise. A true solution to the problem of healthcare is not who pays the bills, but rather to reduce the cost (i.e improve efficiency).","archived":true,"edited":false,"subreddit":"IAmA","score":-1,"retrieved_on":1426549758,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qzb6","created_utc":"1288741241","downs":0,"controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"aletoledo","author_flair_text":null,"name":"t1_c149idg"}

For a year or so we've been living hours apart see each other about as often and you and your guy. (We met in college, graduated, both moved home to different cities.) He also jokes around all the time and likes to, \"pick at\" me. Sometimes I get really frustrated and complain that his joking hurts my feelings or makes me feel like I don't really mean anything to him. When we first started dating, he seemed really \"standoffish\" and was hesitant to verbally express affection. \n\n We've been through some hard times and I must admit that I feel like I've been incredibly patient at times (also with issues related to *past* drug use) with him and questioned the value of our relationship. The difference between him and your guy is that when I expressed my concerns my boyfriend, he INSTANTLY got serious. Whenever I've brought up a real issue with our relationship he is all about what's wrong/how to fix it. He's also made a self-described conscious effort to be more verbally expressive. \n\nMy point is that I, like beertime and others, empathize with you. Your guys sounds a lot like my boyfriend except my boyfriend is FUCKING RAD. He intentionally goes out of his way to show that he does care about me...and that's why we're together now. If I sent him the text you just sent your guy, he would have responded immediately with a concerned call or text asking what had happened.\n\n I think its a general rule, guys will pursue something that they care about. If you don't feel that way, then as another general rule you should just gtfo. -- Obviously everything's not perfect for you. At 22 I would move on...or if its worth it to you, make a big effort to explain how you feel and weigh the results. \n\nOh and speaking of...jokes about your weight? Coke? No thanks. But that's just me. \n\nEDIT: While I was writing this, my bf sent me a text message: \"Whatcha doing, baby?

Instead of mobs spawning at higher brightness than before (which means that rooms with good visibility can still spawn monsters), their spawn threshold should have stayed the same, but torches and other lights should create less light the further down you go. After all, there's more carbon dioxide the deeper you go, so flames wouldn't burn as brightly due to lack of oxygen. So I guess that automatically means that torches should last longer down there too... which would make a good balance against the increased difficulty in lighting areas.","subreddit":"Minecraft","retrieved_on":1426549787,"score":21,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r05i","downs":0,"created_utc":"1288742246","controversiality":0,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"CruftRemover","author_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t1_c149kn6"}

They want to be adults, yet they are too young to be/do that, they think they don't want the guidelines set out for them.\n\nYou have to decide if you want to be everyone's friend or if you want to do what is best for the girls.  But it is really hard to be their friend, and still be authoritative over them.  If you are their friend, they are going to want for you to make exceptions to the rules for them, and if you are their friend and you don't - they will get upset.\n\nPersonally, I don't think your job is to be their friend, but to be their rock - instead.  Let them know what the rules and guidelines are beforehand, and the consequences of breaching those rules and guidelines.","link_id":"t3_e04vq","subreddit_id":"t5_2r367","downs":0,"created_utc":"1288743807","subreddit":"needadvice","retrieved_on":1426549832,"score":1,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"bluequail","author_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t1_c149o45","controversiality":0}

It affected me deeply, not because I knew him, as I didn't, not well at least, but because I was suicidal myself and identified with him. \n\nI had been teased and bullied mercilessly, and until I figured out a defence mechanism for it, I toyed with either going on a murderous rampage (with guns being hard to get a hold of, this was not that easy to do - probably a good thing in hindsight) or just ending it all.\n\nImmediately after the aforementioned suicide, my year coordinator took me into her office and asked me, \"Matjam, are you feeling suicidal? You'd tell me if you we're feeling that way, right? Come on, you can tell me\".\n\nStunned, I sat there, and thought about how the hell I was going to get out of this.\n\nI finally said, \"Um, no, I'm fine. Can I go now?\". She pressed a little then let me go.\n\nI don't know what the solution is for teachers, but they need to get some better tools together to identify and help students than just asking them. Most suicidal people are not just gonna blurt out, actually yes I am, help me. Amirite?\n\nClamping down on bullies (teachers and students) more effectively would be a grand start.\n\nps, those of you still suffering through high school and want to know what the defence mechanism was? At least for me, it was laughing at the bully until he gave up and bullied someone else. It really wasn't that successful, come to think of it, but I'm still here, albeit scarred. All I can tell you is that your life now isn't what it'll be once you're an adult. When you're an adult, you get to choose who you have to spend time with; as a child you are forced into social situations with people who are just dicks.

Don't be afraid of Flash of Light, It sucks up mana pretty fast, but can save you in a tight spot.  My most used spells are Beacon, Holy Shock, Holy Light, Word of Glory.  The only time I even notice a dent in my mana is if I had to go to Flash of Light for a Holy S*** moment.\n\nGet a jetpack for the gunship battle even though you probably won't use it.  I stand on the edge of the deck and can typically heal the people over on the other side just fine.  But I like to have the pack just in case.  Plus it's fun to jump around like a moron before the fight starts.\n\nWhen you fight Precious and Stinky (yes they are trash, but pretty strong trash) they will hit the group with a nasty decimate that reduces health to 15%, so try to position yourself where you can hit as many people as possible with Light of Dawn.\n\nThe first time I healed Dreamwalker I had trouble catching the green orbs inside the portals.  They are easier to catch if you pay attention to their movement and pause a moment near them, letting them hit you instead of you trying to fly through them.  Or maybe this is easy for everyone else and I just suck at flying.  Anyway If you start to one side of Dreamwalker, and fly in front of Dreamwalker in an arc to the other side of her you can usually get at least four or five each time in there, yet still wind up in a good position to throw out some emergency heals if needed to the raid (with Beacon always on Dreamwalker)\n\nIf you get to Sindragosa, try to have at least one instant cast available before getting sucked in with Icy Grip.  One or two people always seem to have a problem running out there, and having an instant heal available to throw while running is a lifesaver.  I also pretty much ignore Unchained Magic, unless we are three-healing and the other two clearly have the healing all covered.  It's better to take a bit of damage myself in a minute than risk letting someone drop.  \n\nI hope some of this is helpful!  I've had a bunch of fun in ICC and don't feel underpowered at all.

All libertarians believe that. \n\nMost libertarians believe that the few things government should be involved in are A. Certain public works (roads, electrical grids ect.) and B. Protection of civil rights (meaning protection from outside threats, and protection against encroachments upon an individual's rights whether it be exploitation, assault, ect.). \n\nWhere right wing and left wing libertarians differ however is that left wing libertarians (alternatively called libertarian socialists) believe those protections should also extend to protections against corporate exploitation (whether it be exploitation of workers or abuse of consumers) and social safety-nets (universal health care, unemployment, maternal and paternal leave ect.) while right wing libertarians do not. None of those things involve central economic planning or redistribution of wealth, however they *do* protect against the emergence of a plutocracy or an oligarchy which right wing libertarianism does not.\n\nIt's fine that you think libertarians are moral absolutists or that conservatism is a less extreme version of it but neither of those are true. I am a libertarian, I'm also a socialist. Libertarianism describes my beliefs on authoritarianism, socialism describes my beliefs on economics. I am pro-free markets, I just believe that companies should be owned democratically. Which is to say if you work there you should be considered a co-owner of the company. That's what socialism is. It has nothing to do with government control of the means of production, that's Stalinism. ","edited":false,"archived":true,"link_id":"t3_e0e7n"}

How dare you be so sober and well explicated!\n\nYour grasp of the economics of insurance is impressive but I suppose I should be more clear and expose my socialist roots. I see access to health care as a right and one that should be available to the public that funds it, just as the roads and the emergency services and military protection we enjoy are. And like those things I don't think it is fair to expect it as an industry to turn a profit or not be a draw on the economy. If we treated it as such, collected funding through the preexisting tax system, eliminated the money being lost to the insurance administration, we would accomplish the mixed pool we seek. But it requires us to view the whole idea of Health Care differently and accept that, yes, it is costly (but not as mucha s defense...)\n\nOn your second point, I would only urge those on the right to use this price oriented perspective on all of their policy decisions. I wonder how entangled in the Middle East we would be right now if that was the prism they viewed the situation through.\n\n&gt;In short you are perfectly right that the conservative agenda is to preserve the existing wealth and power (or more precisely the framework of existing wealth and power) on the basis that generations of effort (the same generations of progress you give progressives credit for) lead to said framework and it should not be frittered away by someone(s) who unable to actually create the wealth or accrue the power now proposes that they know best how to dispense it.\n\nThis... wow. I am not sure you could state it more perfectly. My only issue, and it is not with the premise but the players, is that I don't think the \"haves\" can see the difference, or perhaps even care about the difference, between knowing best how to use wealth and power and knowing best how to use it for the good of us all. I am not one of those \"they are standing on the shoulders of giants\" types but I do think the elite stand on our collective shoulders and should bare some responsibility for the rest of us, if for no other reason than to protect the consumers that make them rich :)","edited":false,"archived":true,"link_id":"t3_e08b4","created_utc":"1288764333","downs":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qzb6","retrieved_on":1426550427,"score":35,"subreddit":"IAmA","name":"t1_c14axzu","author":"rhoner","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"controversiality":0}

We generally look for a minimum P-value of .05 but ideally .01 before we reject the null hypothsis.\n\nOne thing that is very obvious in my dept. (&amp; when I hve asked ppl in other depts they feel the same) is that science has become very compartmentalised with everyone working on their tiny (but complex) part of the puzzle. There are people in my dept who essentially have the same job title as me, but would not be able to tell you why I do something one way rather than another or why I adjust the data in a particular way before analysing it (there are very good reasons and it actually makes the results more dependable than if you didn't). Of course when I come to publish my data they will send my paper to people who work on the same problems and will understand why I have done things that way. Alternatively they'll ask me to explain my reasoning and if I can't convince them... change my methods. This is the reason I would be very doubtful that just any physics student/prof would automatically know the whys and wherefores of a climate paper.\n\nThe idea that Hal Lewis would be 'better' qualified seems a bit presumptious. Yes, he has had a long career, but his knowledge of the basics stems from the 1930-40's and unless he has kept up with the latest work I find it hard to believe that he is more quailified than someone who has spent the last 30yrs of their life devoted to the subject!\n\nI for instance know enough to understand quite a bit of the papers, but I definitely wouldn't presume to understand all the reasoning for using a particular statistical adjustment or one technique over another. That's the reason we use peer-review!\n\nWhen it comes to 'the hockey stick graph' which was first publish back in 2001, more than twelve subsequent scientific papers using various statistical techniques and combinations of proxy records produced reconstructions broadly the same as the original hockey stick graphs. They vary in the extent to which the Medieval Warm Period and subsequent \"little ice age\" were significant, but almost all of them supported the IPCC conclusion that the warmest decade in 1000 years was probably that at the end of the 20th century. There have also been disputes about the use of Bristlecone and Foxtail Pine tree rings as temperature proxies \u2014 the National Research Council report recommends that \u201cstrip-bark\u201d samples be avoided for temperature reconstructions \u2013 but the same \"hockey stick\" graph is found in studies which do not use tree ring proxies. Basically, yes, the first study was flawed, but as it tends to, science has moved on and has found better techniques. Also, the reason the problem with the graph did not change the opinion of the IPCC was that although it was the easiest to understand by the lay person it was definitely not the lynch pin in the evidence. The evidence for warming comes from many different sources, laboratories and scientists from all over the globe....you can remove a number of pieces and still have the evidence stand as a whole.\n\nMy major problem with the majority of climate sceptics is that they spend all their time saying that 'the data isn't right' 'the technique they used was wrong' or just 'they are liars and frauds' but they very rarely provide their own analysis of the data or suggest what technique should be used to make it right (I have noticed the same thing with creationists &amp; evolution). This year the UK Met office has released all their climate data and along with the university as the center of 'climategate' so it will be interesting to see if any new research is published. There is plently of funding out their for anyone to do their own research (the oil industry would build you a house of gold if you could conclusively prove anything), if someone can prove that global warming truely isn't happening then I (&amp; I'm sure many others) will be very relieved! \n\nOf course there are always those that point to some sort of conspiracy to keep the real results hidden. There for me lies a real problem....to somehow get that number of scientists, from almost every industrialised nation in the world, to leave their morals at the door and deliberately mislead everyone about the results of their work seems unfeasible. Definitely a conspiracy of epic proportions! \n\nGenerally I try to use occam's razor in these situations and it seems to me to be that the simpler explanation is that the majority of climate scientists are trying to accurately describe their work and are not spending their time manipulating it for their own nefarious ends.\n\nP.s. I'm sure you know that google rankings mean nothing (although perhaps at best what is most controversial).\n\nEDIT: I have to say that for the most part my Dad has the same point of view as you (in that he believe money has influenced the results from the IPCC) &amp; I have said the same things to him.....I don't think he's likely to change his mind as he has said that it's just that it's more of a feeling he has and just doesn't 'believe' in global warming.","author_flair_text":null,"subreddit":"environment","edited":true,"created_utc":"1288777481","distinguished":null,"link_id":"t3_dzllz","downs":0,"retrieved_on":1426550627,"controversiality":0,"author":"naturalalchemy","archived":true,"author_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0}

That or move back to a more outdoorsy climate.","ups":3,"id":"c14bnth","score":3,"score_hidden":false,"parent_id":"t3_e0kng","name":"t1_c14bnth","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","link_id":"t3_e0kng","distinguished":null,"created_utc":"1288790197","subreddit":"AskReddit","edited":true,"author_flair_text":null}
