{"distinguished":null,"body":"It's an apocalyptic novel. Basically, it's sometime in the future - widespread desertification, water shortages, global warming, etc. There's a planet everyone thinks can support life. China's manned shuttle returns and within 48 hours the entire government has pulled out of the country for the new planet. Economy breaks down, panic, looting. The US realizes they need to head out too before the government is overthrown. They have limited space so there's a process of being selected for the shuttle. The story itself is through the eyes of three people.\n\nThat's it in a nutshell. I've never really done something like this but I'm excited. There's a bunch of details I obviously didn't hammer out but I guess I'll figure those out in the re-write.

I upgrade with every new release, but I could stick with this version for years, only upgrading my kernel and other bits as necessary.\r\n\r\nYou have your the core utilities (supplemented by slackpkg, sbopkg and src2pkg), a desktop environment/window manager of choice and software on top of that.  Some say the core utilities are long in the tooth, but that's what makes the platform possible.\r\n\r\nOf course you have to open it up to give people a choice of desktop environments (Slackware has KDE, XFCE, Fluxbox, blackbox, windowmaker, fvm2 and twm, and I compiled e17 in addition to openbox), but once you pick one you're basically there: core, graphical layer and software.  And KDE seems to be the DE of choice, as well as being the most automagical of the choices, so you could stick with that.\r\n\r\nI think it's basically because Slackware develops for stability and simplicity, ships the most vanilla packages I've ever seen, and has a DIY community that builds tools like src2pkg, slackbuilds and its sbopkg so that instead of needing a backport or an official package from the distro, you can just build what you need.\r\n\r\nYou also don't have all the problems introduced by featureitis, such as switching from straight gnome to an in-house unity desktop.  And because things are vanilla and the distro is built for a DIY kind of person (though you don't have to be to use it), all the tools are there and you run into fewer problems.\r\n\r\nIt has the reputation of being hard to configure, but that's outdated.  Between the new kernel abilities and the KDE4 or XFCE4 desktop, you don't need to configure anything to be running a complete desktop that is the equal of anything out there.  And I think it meets the platform model, because it's easy to upgrade anything from the kernel to your widgets while leaving the core utilities intact.","archived":true,"subreddit":"linux","author":"1369ic","distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1a","author_flair_css_class":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1288572992","downs":0,"name":"t1_c141fxc","parent_id":"t3_dz5n8"}

This, 1998, is of course the high point of the El Nino and this year's El Nino did not quite make the grade as high as the 98 one. The La Nina we are entering should drive temperatures down so as to track a declining temperature trend over the past 12 years.[here](http://climate4you.com/GlobalTemperatures.htm)\n\n\nSteve McIntyre : \n\"Making readers run the gauntlet of trying to guess the precise data sets\nand precise methodologies obviously makes it very difficult to achieve any\nassessment of the statistical properties. In order to test the GISS\nadjustments, I requested that GISS provide me with details on their\nadjustment code. They refused. Nevertheless, there are enough different\nversions of U.S. station data (USHCN raw, USHCN time-of-observation\nadjusted, USHCN adjusted, GHCN raw, GHCN adjusted) that one can compare GISS\nraw and GISS adjusted data to other versions to get some idea of what they\ndid.\"\n\"In the course of reviewing quality problems at various surface sites,\namong other things, I compared these different versions of station data,\nincluding a comparison of the Tucson weather station shown above to the\nGrand Canyon weather station, which is presumably less affected by urban\nproblems. This comparison demonstrated a very odd pattern discussed\nhere. The adjustments show that the trend in the problematic Tucson site\nwas reduced in the course of the adjustments, but they also showed that the\nGrand Canyon data was also adjusted, so that, instead of the 1930s being\nwarmer than the present as in the raw data, the 2000s were warmer than the\n1930s, with a sharp increase in the 2000s.\n\nFigure 6. Comparison of Tucson and Grand Canyon Versions\n\nNow some portion of the post-2000 jump in adjusted Grand Canyon values\nshown here is due to Hansen\u2019s Y2K error, but it only accounts for a 0.5 deg\nC jump after 2000 and does not explain why Grand Canyon values should have\nbeen adjusted so much. In this case, the adjustments are primarily at the\nUSHCN stage. The USHCN station history adjustments appear particularly\ntroublesome to me, not just here but at other sites (e.g. Orland CA). They\nend up making material changes to sites identified as \u201cgood\u201d sites and my\nimpression is that the USHCN adjustment procedures may be adjusting some of\nthe very \u201cbest\u201d sites (in terms of appearance and reported history) to\nbetter fit histories from sites that are clearly non-compliant with WMO\nstandards (e.g. Marysville, Tucson). There are some real and interesting\nstatistical issues with the USHCN station history adjustment procedure and\nit is ridiculous that the source code for these adjustments (and the\nsubsequent GISS adjustments \u2013 see bottom panel) is not available/\n\nClosing the circle: my original interest in GISS adjustment procedures\nwas not an abstract interest, but a specific interest in whether GISS\nadjustment procedures were equal to the challenge of \u201cfixing\u201d bad data. If\none views the above assessment as a type of limited software audit (limited\nby lack of access to source code and operating manuals), one can say firmly\nthat the GISS software had not only failed to pick up and correct fictitious\nsteps of up to 1 deg C, but that GISS actually introduced this error in the\ncourse of their programming.\"\n\n[images](http://www.surfacestations.org/ca/grand_12.gif)\n[and](http://www.surfacestations.org/ca/grand_15.gif)\n\nThis of course is just one instance where GISS has been caught engaging in this sort of nonsense....There have been many other examples  such as not applying  UHI corrections to a location with urban heating thereby making it appear to be a rural station and therefore the higher temperatures are \"PROOF\" of global warming.","subreddit":"science","author":"butch123","archived":true,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1288576580","author_flair_text":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","author_flair_css_class":null,"parent_id":"t1_c1413r0","name":"t1_c141mcu","downs":0}

You have the capability to travel to the ends of the universe, to live eternally in good health, and get this, to create life de novo. Now this creating life business isn't as easy as a snap of a finger, unlike cooking dinner in this distant future. In fact, this vivogenesis requires building the most elaborate Machine ever conceived.\n\nSo you and a team of engineers set out to construct this Machine. You place into this Machine-system 200 elemental raw building blocks. You write a programming language of sorts to govern this system, and also electro-chemical-physical laws to define how these elemental blocks can interact with each other. Needless to say, this machine is a bit more complex than your run-of-the-mill automated Higgs-boson synthesis machine. This machine and its products intimately interact, and do not exist as separate entities.\n\nYou've constructed your Machine, what now? The team wrote a program for generating this very specific life form, designated as project title namuH. You load the program into the Machine-system and let it run. Because you're basically immaculate at this point in your time and space since you're so advanced, you're absolutely confident your program is flawless and will create a perfect namuH, and it does. The program specifies that to generate the namuH, several byproducts must be formed. The initial phase of the synthesis process yields an intermediate that looks nothing like the namuH, in fact it's tiny, nanoscopically tiny. This tiny intermediate is further processed and developed into a multi-body lifeform, but it's still very far away from the namuH. A few lifeforms existing as functional \"organisms\" are developed, and exits the developmental pathway as quasi-stable byproducts. These byproducts, you've designed, will actually serve to sustain the namuH once it's formed. Finally after a month or two of running the program with many byproduct organisms accumulated, the first namuH becomes operational.\n\nYou and your dev team are stoked. During the 2 months of vivogenesis, your team wrote up a patch to address the exceedingly long production/manufacturing process--because eventually you'd like to mass produce the namuH. This patch basically enables a copy, merge, randomize, paste function to occur between two interacting flavors of namuHs or any byproducts to procreate new, unique lifeforms, thus bypassing running the original program from line 1 every time you wanted to produce a replacement lifeform. This update patch was not retro-compatible to certain byproducts, so they still function on the auto-regeneration program. One downside to this patch is that aberrations arise every time a lifeform is procreated on account of the randomization function; each individual is no longer perfect/free of mutation. However, your boss is still ecstatic you cut production time and manufacturing materials by several magnitudes of power.\n\nProject namuH was special, because the intention was to create a lifeform that is self-aware, capable of self-regeneration, and possesses the ability to learn, rationalize, create ideas, and express intelligence--features that none of the byproduct lifeforms possessed in whole. Years down the line, Project namuH and its Machine-system reached operational self-sustaining sufficiency. Indeed the intelligent namuHs learned to appreciate themselves, each other, and the Machine-system that so elegantly sustained them and produced them. Because you and your team developed an entirely different set of physical laws from your own to govern namuHs, you have a hard time communicating to these intelligent creatures. Yet, you've grown very fond of them and you love them nonetheless.\n\nLater on, your employer has decided to discontinue the project's funds. But since the system has become self-sufficient because of an excellent closed-system conservation of mass and energy, you and your team leave it running at no cost. You check in from time to time to see how your Humans are doing.","distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"ups":1,"score":1,"edited":false,"retrieved_on":1426546143,"score_hidden":false,"id":"c141twq","link_id":"t3_dz4nf"}

Stories about having their children taken away from them. Stories about going to jail or almost going to jail because of a false accusation. These are serious, serious issues that have hurt people deeply. Why is it so important to admonish them for it? Why not try to talk with them, reason with them - take the abuse they spew and show kindness in return - and figure out why they are so vitriolic?\n\n... are words I will practice taking to heart.

Well, that proves terrorism is superreal! Do you not feel scared? Watch a video of people jumping from the towers. If you feel terrorized now, it proves terrorism is superreal. If not, download a video of Osama that was found by pure luck in a random building in Afghanistan (God...err I mean the flying spaghetti monster, is on our side fellow intellectuals!), in which he tells us he was the superreal 911-doer, and if you feel scared now, well, that proves that terrorism is real, because you just got a little terrorized! If you still think terrorism is fake, look for some of the pictures of the dismembered corpses found on 9/11. If you feel kind of sick in your stomach, well, that feeling is caused by terrorism, and thus, as we scientists like to call it, we indirectly detected terrorism!

What sort of life you've lived has nothing to do with your capability to do that.\" It's not that easy, and a lot of the aggression that gets bottled inside from a confused childhood is often expressed through violent and self-destructive means. The child's mind doesn't know how to process complex and painful experiences, and those experiences and their accompanying emotions are almost always repressed, which in turn usually leads to acting out. There's always a complex, moving story behind why people are who they are, and why they do what they do. You never, ever know what it's like to be another person.

If a shark tried to use its nares while resting on the ocean floor, it would \"inhale\" sand rather than water. Many scientists believe this is one of the reasons sharks have spiracles. The spiny dogfish's spinal cord, rather than its brain, coordinates swimming, so spiny dogfish can continue to swim while sleeping.[48] It is also possible that sharks sleep in a manner similar to dolphins,[48] one cerebral hemisphere at a time, thus maintaining some consciousness and cerebral activity at all times.\n","link_id":"t3_dze0t","gilded":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","archived":true,"author":"thedarkhaze","id":"c142fby","parent_id":"t3_dze0t"}

Make a date of it, or go with a friend. Normal donations are over pretty quickly.\n\nI was donating blood regularly before I moved... still would if there was a closer facility to me. I also did platelets a few times, which was kind of weird... being that you have a tube in each arm and your blood is returned to your body after having platelets removed in a machine. It takes about an hour or so, depending on BP or whatever. They cover you in blankets and make you really comfortable with headphones and a dvd. It's not that bad... hands get a little cold from lower circulation but that's why you squeeze the little stress ball the OP mentioned.\n\nI first became interested in this because my father does it all the time (he's type o negative, I'm a positive). He has little plaques and certificates for having donated so much throughout his lifetime, but he doesn't even know/care where he put them. He was a medic in the Army... sure he understands how important these donations can be more than most of us."}

I've been extremely attracted to at least one guy who was half a foot shorter than me, and I'm 5'4.\n\nIt's hard to define what gets one's sexual motor going, or I guess, oiled. There's stuff that goes into it that demands some difficult examination of murky territory. I believe a lot of our sexuality is set in our childhoods and when we are older thinking about kids thinking about sex can be icky. I can remember having some very explicit fantasies when I was nine and the main themes that trampled through my head then still get me going now. Why do men like boobs?\n\nThere's two reasons I think I have a special fondness for tall men. Firstly; I'm short and I've been physically pushed around and threatened on and off. Having a big guy around who loves you and will protect you is reassuring. It also means he can protect children, which is not on my mind when I check out a guy, but it might be wired into me. I don't like that as evolutionary biological hard-wiring is often used to justify all sorts of stupid and demeaning theories about men and women. But there it is, just because I don't like it, doesn't mean there's nothing to it and I'm no expert.\n\nThe second is culture. Pick up a romance book and the hero is likely to be tall. Same with other genres. Tall is associated with success. And who doesn't want a successful lover? Again, this doesn't go through my head in any conscious way, but I figure I might be conditioned into it.\n\nOh and here's a third. Bonus! Culturally women are meant to be smaller than men, men bigger than women. Frankly that's stupid. It's unnecessary. But that's what we've been told and shown from an early age. Again, doesn't bother me when it comes to dudes I know, however it might be acting on your friend. even if she was smaller than the 5'7 guy, her libido may demand greater height difference.\n\nI hope this has been a bit helpful and not as scattered as I feel it is."}

No matter how you frame it, it's not \"just your opinion\", it's you inserting yourself annoyingly into a conversation and self-righteously demonizing both a fellow Redditor and a question thread about muscle tension. It's not a thread about what you personally find distasteful. That's called \"being an asshole\" and your juvenile horseshit stifles participation. If you're not someone's boring-ass soccer mom, this is inexcusable behavior and it's not ok.

And that's just a short, 2.5 hour flight. \n\nThis brings me to another point, if you're trying to use a phone as a detonator, and you put it into airplane mode to save battery, you aren't going to call that bitch cause it's radio is off. In other words, the radio that would be receiving a call, is off, to conserve battery. \n\n2c) This is true, it's usually not. However, it's flight at 30k feet where reception is a problem. That's where the drain on the battery takes place - it may not kill the phone, but is that a risk you're willing to take if you're serious about this bomb going off?","created_utc":"1288616162","score_hidden":false,"ups":5,"controversiality":0,"gilded":0,"link_id":"t3_dz74a","id":"c142v3c","author":"tejmin","parent_id":"t1_c142igd","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","archived":true}

The Congress will be transferring to the Obama Administration authority in a number of different areas over the lives of the American people and the businesses they own. The irony is that the Congress doesn\u2019t have any authority to legislate in most of those areas to begin with. I defy anyone to read the text of the U.S. Constitution and find any authority granted to the members of Congress to regulate health care.\n\nThe argument about Congressional authority simply boils down to differing interpretations of the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, which gives Congress the power \"to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states, and with the Indian tribes.\" Generally speaking, the Commerce clause is the go-to authority for Federal Government regulation. The modern legal \"test\" that a Commerce Clause-based regulation is known as \"Rational Basis.\" The rational basis review tests whether a governmental action is a reasonable means to an end that may be legitimately pursued by the government. This test requires that the governmental action be \u201crationally related\u201d to a \u201clegitimate\u201d government interest. Under this standard of review, the \u201clegitimate interest\u201d does not have to be the government\u2019s actual interest. Rather, if the court can merely hypothesize a \u201clegitimate\u201d interest served by the challenged action, it will withstand the rational basis review.\n\nIs the health of our nation not a \"legitimate government interest\"? Sleep on that.\n\nSpecifically regarding health care, the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel said in 1993 (with quotes from a 1940 Supreme Court decision - yes, 1940):\n\n&gt;&gt;Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel, 1993: The American health care industry is one of the largest and fastest growing segments of the American economy, and it has the most direct and crucial impact on the lives of all Americans. Spiralling health care costs and inequities in the provision of health care services have an immediate and massive effect on the national economy and thus upon interstate commerce. As a result Congress unquestionably possesses the power \"to deal directly and specifically\" with health care in order to obtain \"social, health [and] economic advantages\" for the American people.\n\nIs Connelly therefore wrong when he asserts that Congress lacks this power? No, but he's not \"right\" either. This is a question for the Supreme Court of the United States, not some hack Lionel Hutz from Louisiana. And the fact that he provides zero reasoning as to why his conclusion is correct is an obvious indication that he's just trolling you for notoriety. I truly hope that if/when a Supreme Court decision is ever passed on this issue, a Justice mentions in dicta that he hath defied Michael Connelly.\n\n&gt;This legislation also provides for access by the appointees of the Obama administration of all of your personal healthcare information...\n\nNo shit.\n\n&gt;...your personal financial information\n\nActually, that would be the IRS.\n\n&gt;...and the information of your employer, physician, and hospital. \n\nActually, that would be the Yellow Pages.\n\n&gt;All of this is a direct violation of the specific provisions of the 4th Amendment to the Constitution protecting against unreasonable searches and seizures. You can also forget about the right to privacy. That will have been legislated into oblivion regardless of what the 3rd and 4th Amendments may provide.\n\n&gt;&gt;Third Amendment: No Soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the Owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law.\n\n&gt;&gt;Fourth Amendment: The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\n\nPrivacy of medical history has nothing to do with either of these Amendments. If you require more explanation about this issue, please do not vote, drive, or run with scissors.\n\n&gt;If you decide not to have healthcare insurance or if you have private insurance that is not deemed \"acceptable\" to the \"Health Choices Administrator\" appointed by Obama there will be a tax imposed on you. It is called a \"tax\" instead of a fine because of the intent to avoid application of the due process clause of the 5th Amendment.\n\nThis is actually true, and does raise questions of Constitutionality. Note that I said Constitutionality, not fairness. Do not confuse the two. This isn't a matter of \"is the penalty reasonable?\" This isn't even a matter of \"does this tax even make sense?\" This is purely a matter of \"Can Congress levy a tax (like this)?\" It's a fundamental question and certainly not one that any layperson would ever contemplate or care about.\n\nThis is the mechanism in the bill to enforce the individual mandate requiring everyone to have insurance. A person who doesn\u2019t have insurance that meets minimum benefit standards (or other acceptable coverage, such as a plan that was grandfathered in) would pay a penalty of 2.5 percent of modified adjusted gross income for the year. The total penalty can\u2019t exceed a national average premium for individual coverage, or family coverage if applicable. But ask yourself this: if the goal of the overhaul is to provide affordable health care to damn near every single American, then why is this even relevant? The point is moot in theory and in practice.\n\n&gt;However, that doesn\u2019t work because since there is nothing in the law that allows you to contest or appeal the imposition of the tax, it is definitely depriving someone of property without the \"due process of law.\"\n\nTBD by the Supreme Court if necessary. Will have no real effect on any American's life or liberty beyond dorky Con Law implications.\n\n&gt;So, there are three of those pesky amendments that the far left hate so much out the original ten in the Bill of Rights that are effectively nullified by this law. \n\nOne Amendment (5th), actually. PS. It should be obvious by now that Connelly has a distinctly partisan outlook on life (\"pesky Amendments\")","created_utc":"1288620035","ups":1,"controversiality":0,"score_hidden":false,"gilded":0,"link_id":"t3_dzhrk","parent_id":"t3_dzhrk","author":"ajd6c8","id":"c14302a","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","archived":true}

Can these guys sense me or will they wander off eventually. Am I stuck burrowing for now?\n\nThe first pic is an unaltered screenshot. The second was brightened in Picasa. I'm looking into more info on the nature of Monitor/TV calibration (hardware and software) to see where we should really be. Please let me know how well you see both pics and what kind of Monitor/TV you're using and GPU/Driver version settings etc.\n\nI have an ATi Radeon HD 4650 connected to a Samsung LN52A650 52\" LCD HDTV via HDMI. I'm using Catalyst 10.10. Once I found the damn settings, I discovered the Pixel Format was set to RGB 4:4:4 (Full PC RGB). I used Calman Pattern Generator to make a full range grey scale pattern and made adjustments to the TV (not the video card).\n\nThis is how I found what can only be described as *night vision*...\n\nI knew that can't be right for my TV, so I switched to RGB 4:4:4 Limited Studio Levels and used Calman again this time generating a video levels grey scale pattern and readjusted my TV accordingly. Now my picture is not as dark as it once was, but I can still make out sand and water in the moonlight. I think it looks really great now, but the Nether still looks *dangerously* dark.\n\nWe need to find out how this game is *supposed* to look somehow. Between the game itself, Java, the OS, video cards/drivers a particular video signal is being generated. Once that has been identified, we can begin to properly adjust our monitors to display that signal correctly.\n\nI also found an item duping trick on accident using item boxes in single player... is this something that is well known?","ups":1,"score_hidden":false,"controversiality":0,"edited":true,"subreddit":"Minecraft","distinguished":null,"name":"t1_c1431sy","downs":0,"score":1,"author_flair_text":"","retrieved_on":1426546727,"author_flair_css_class":"spider"}

There's a misinterpretation here. Traditional NN arguments pinpoint the ISP as the culprit of denying delivery of content after *they* require the *content provider* to to pay *them* for delivery. \n\nThe idea is to prevent communications networks from controlling content that wishes to be delivered. The reasons for this vary, but the prevailing factor is that there are limited (if any) choices for consumers between providers, and there is often some level of public funding for infrastructure, which is part of the argument that it is a public communications network, though that is essentially what's being debated.\n\n*This* example is the exact opposite. ESPN is charging for delivery of their content.\n\nWhile it may eventually be added into the NN debate as another example of what damage can be done to consumers, with its own proposed solutions, this is not the same old problem, and I'll submit a reason why it shouldn't be considered a problem.\n\nWith my limited knowledge of how TV is regulated, it's perfectly acceptable for content providers to deny networks access to the content. It happened recently with Cablevision and FOX networks, which has since been worked out. Service providers pay certain content providers to deliver their private assets as a part of their service.\n\nFor an example on the Internet, it's legal for a content provider *(like if you own your own site)* to block access from any block of IP's for any reason. You're on a private network, and can make that private network as private as you want within legal limits, just like if you own land. You would probably want to do this in the case of a certain IP attacking you.\n\nWhat NN says is that it should be illegal for the larger network of Comcast/Cablevision, to deny throughput or charge throughput fees to deliver a content provider's content. I'm wary of further analogizing, but you might consider this your town not allowing you to leave your land, or the next town over not allowing you to pass through because of where you're from--perhaps without paying a fee.\n\nEDIT: clarity. \n\nEDIT3: removed the useless and confusing EDIT2.\n\n**TL;DR** - It's fucking complicated, and more every day you can't just clump up things as a blanket Net Neutrality issue and vote for Net Neutrality. Specifics need to be debated if anything is to be regulated without negative repercussions."}

If you were really determined to do any of these things, enough study and enough time devoted to the matter will allow you to do it. The idea that artists just sit down, bust out perfect art with no effort and continue on with their day is a falsehood.

Yes, there are people who have more of an inclination or ability to learn the material faster, but they _still have to practice and learn._\n\nYou could paint if you started doing it for 12 months each week. You could draw if you just sat down with a pencil, maybe read a few books, and started drawing. You could play an instrument if you struggled through that awkward first phase.\n\nYou need to select what you want to do and pursue it with vigor.

I ended up leaving my Masters program and getting a job in finance, on the cusp of technology and quantitative work.  I'm not complaining.\n\nThat said, for the purposes of getting a great (paying) job, math is fantastic.  It's applicable to a vast variety of fields and a Ph.D. will certainly get you through the door a lot quicker.  Arguably, a Master's degree is expensive and won't carry as much weight, but is still unquestionably better than a bachelor's degree (in terms of getting you through the door, not necessarily preparing you).\n\nYou should think about what you love to do.  If you go for an advanced degree in math, chances are you love math and will forego income for your love.  It will also be brutally difficult.  Not unlike \"studying\" chess, it is my opinion that you can only go so far on pure hard work in pure mathematics, and sometimes it might not be worth it (i.e. for simply the glory of a Ph.D.).

Of course the democratic process is presented as the one and only \u201csomething\u201d you can do. It's not. Additionally, what if the thing you take issue with is the process itself? Imposing one-size-fits-all solutions based on who can amass the biggest gang is not the only or best way for society to address problems.

We reject electoral politics, in theory and in practice, as incompatible with libertarian principles. Governments must cloak their actions in an aura of moral legitimacy in order to sustain their power, and political methods invariably strengthen that legitimacy. Voluntaryists seek instead to delegitimize the State through education, and we advocate withdrawal of the cooperation and tacit consent on which State power ultimately depends.\n\n-[Articles on non-voting @ voluntaryist.com](http://www.voluntaryist.com/nonvoting/index.html)\n\n&gt;Each year when election time rolls around, we are sternly reminded from all quarters that it is our \u201cduty\u201d to vote.

Two plus two equals four regardless of how many people vote that it equals five.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Individuals have rights which do not depend on the outcome of elections. Majorities of voters cannot vote away the rights of a single individual or groups of individuals.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Voting is implicitly a coercive act because it lends support to a compulsory government.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Voting reinforces the legitimacy of the state because the participation of the voters makes it appear that they approve of their government.\n\n-[Non-voting @ strike-the-root.com](http://www.strike-the-root.com/vote.html)\n\n&gt;When we place voting into the framework of politics, however, a major change occurs. When we express a preference politically, we do so precisely because we intend to bind others to our will. Political voting is the legal method we have adopted and extolled for obtaining monopolies of power. Political voting is nothing more than the assumption that might makes right. There is a presumption that any decision wanted by the majority of those expressing a preference must be desirable, and the inference even goes so far as to presume that anyone who differs from a majority view is wrong or possibly immoral.\n&gt;\n&gt;But history shows repeatedly the madness of crowds and the irrationality of majorities. The only conceivable merit relating to majority rule lies in the fact that if we obtain monopoly decisions by this process, we will coerce fewer persons than if we permit the minority to coerce the majority. But implicit in all political voting is the necessity to coerce some so that all are controlled. The direction taken by the control is academic. Control as a monopoly in the hands of the state is basic.\n&gt;\n&gt;In times such as these, it is incumbent upon free men to reexamine their most cherished, long-established beliefs. There is only one truly moral position for an honest person to take. He must refrain from coercing his fellows. This means that he should refuse to participate in the process by means of which some men obtain power over others. If you value your right to life, liberty, and property, then clearly there is every reason to refrain from participating in a process that is calculated to remove the life, liberty, or property from any other person. Voting is the method for obtaining legal power to coerce others.\n\n-[Abstain from Beans, by Robert LeFevre](http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig7/lefevre2.html)\n\n-[The Truth About Voting](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO9AtSwjV1s)","edited":false,"archived":true,"link_id":"t3_dzt81","score_hidden":false,"ups":3,"distinguished":null,"parent_id":"t3_dzt81","id":"c145rs4","gilded":0}

And attempting to hide that behind some prissy wording isn't helping.  \n\nThe only thing that I'm going to say about the Riemann hypothesis is that a whole bunch of people have written hundred of books based purely on the statement \"If god is real...\".  Some of the writing are quite interesting.  But even with all the raping and pillaging and good old fashion incest, should we really take these books as gospel and live our lives according to them?  We never deny that some nice results may follow should it be true, or at least for some people.  The rest get thrown into a fire, depending on who you listen to.  But really...if an all knowing being that created the universe actually exists, wouldn't the mere existence of the universe be considered as much proof as multiple million zeroes?  Or is it that you need a lot more proof before you can even begin to make that assumption?  If the Riemann hypothesis is so obvious to solve, why hasn't it been solved yet?  And when it is solved, won't it need a little more proof than just something you think is obvious?  If there was absolutely no proof for it, would you even have mentioned it?  Wouldn't it seem a little ridiculous to believe in something with absolutely no proof supporting it?\n\nShowing that a hypothesis does not have evidence to support it's claims, mathematical or otherwise, is not proving that it's false.  Especially when you change the wording of the problem, therefore changing the expected results.  That's called \"refining your hypothesis\", a very common tool in both science and mathematics.

This proposition has many benefits, ranging from fiscal to personal freedom.  Ending the prohibition of cannabis would generate extraordinary tax revenue for the state of California.  Also, legalizing cannabis would deal a major blow to drug cartels, as people would have a legitimate source for cannabis.  It also is extremely important to stress the lack of danger of cannabis.  It is a fact that nobody has ever died from cannabis, and the drug has many health benefits.  There are thousands of responsible adults who smoke cannabis and live successful, positive lives.  Proposition 19 passing would allow these adults to not live in fear.  If you have any questions whatsoever, please let me know and I would love to discuss them with you.  November 2, 2010 could become a historical date, and you could be a part of that.  Please vote yes on Proposition 19.\n\nThank you for your time."}

And you don't just let the person sit there while you look into it.\n\n4.  How is this icompetent?  If he left the driver alone while he investigated it, that would be incompetent.  A police officer doesn't break into a drug dealer's house and then wait patiently outside for him to come out, all the while giving the drug dealer time to flush his stash or grab a gun.  Now, I know the situation is different, but Police will always be cautious.  And you can't use argument that he's an accountant.\n\n5. Police brutality.  Again we only have half a story.  Some people will likely not agree that they were physically resisting a police officer.  Or will not see it that way. \n\n6. How would arrest/detaining somebody that could've potentialy stolen a car be false?  Arrest != charged.\n","archived":true,"edited":false,"link_id":"t3_dzlv5","created_utc":"1288669878","downs":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qh61","retrieved_on":1426548124,"score":3,"subreddit":"WTF","name":"t1_c14609t","author":"asoap","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"controversiality":0}

They were the kind of Christians who just accepted God as fact, but didn't feel the need to go to church or read the bible. They simply didn't think about that kind of stuff. I guess they were your typical suburban middle-class family. Eventually I came to atheism on my own, and when my mom found out (saw something I had written about atheism) she freaked out. It was the strangest thing, since we never really spoke about religion at all. We never spoke about it after that either, and when I see her now, she'll occasionally make a remark about God, but seems to have forgotten about my atheism.\n\nMy girlfriend, however, was raised atheist in China. Her family never talked about religion, but in a different way than mine. They accepted the non-existence of God as fact. When I talk to her about it, she tells me that God just never had any place in her world-view; just like you, she always thought of the existence of God as ludicrous.\n\nThe main difference between us is that I'm much more interested in atheism than she is. She doesn't like to talk about it, to debate it. She doesn't like to read Dawkins, Harris, or even Sagan. She doesn't like the \"new atheists\" (for lack of a better term), of which I consider myself a part of. While I can articulate exactly why I don't believe, she just says that she doesn't believe. That she can't believe, and that she doesn't need a reason to not believe. While I agree with that in part (one should need a reason to believe in something, not a reason not to), it's difficult because she's not interested in anything like that at all, and not interested in thinking about the implications of religion or atheism. It's like she thinks, \"why would we need to talk about it? It's obviously false, but if people want to believe it, there's no reason we should change their minds.\" She's a fatalist, where she accepts how things are and doesn't think anything should change.\n\nBasically, we believe the same thing, but arrived at it in and view it in two very different ways.","edited":false,"archived":true}

Banelings had speed upgrade, and my marines had stim, shields, and +1 (which is realistically what I would get as early as possible) On creep it was much tougher, and obviously these are ideal conditions (I know what's going on, I'm prepared, etc)\n\nCombine that with [this Marine/Raven strategy](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=163605), and honestly I feel that if both players went pure banelings and pure marines, the games would be pretty close. The ravens are a decent deterrent to infestors, hydras, mutas, and even banelings, but even if you exclude them, cheap mass marine production is surprisingly pretty strong especially if you poke at the right time. I don't think pure marine would work very well if the zerg stays on 2 bases though, but I've never really seen pure baneling on 2 bases versus pure marine on 2 bases, so it's speculation.\n\nStill, you're right, if 2 players (pro or amateur) went pure marine vs pure baneling, I wouldn't be surprised if the banelings rolled the marines hard. Even some of the variants of the raven/marine build involve siege tanks, and they're very effective. I guess all I meant was that I think mass marine play is still pretty amazing, and surprisingly robust against its supposed hard counters of baneling and infestor.","edited":false,"archived":true,"ups":3,"distinguished":null,"parent_id":"t1_c1466c7","gilded":0,"id":"c1468cl","score_hidden":false}

There is no reason for any educated adult to assume anarchism is violent or chaotic or dangerous in any way. It is understandable, however, that many, many people are continually indoctrinated to see anarchists as bomb-throwing, dagger-slinking assassins hell-bent on spreading terror and violent uproar for no logical reason. You have to ask yourself why this image is continually forced upon the masses when only a precursory understanding of what anarchist philosophy engenders shows it to be a system of mutual aid, democratic equality and political freedom, though.\n\nAnarchists are organized without authority. They are still organized. Anarchism comes from the Greek AnArchos- An: 'Without' Archos: 'Archons'. This in no way means violent chaos, upheaval, destruction, tyranny of suffering. Yet... how many media outlets continually enforce this false image?\n\nArchons are figures of authority. Archons are expressions of a system that uses authority to validate itself. So, what then, is authority?\n\nAuthority is violence, plain and simple. Authority is punishment if you don't do what you are ordered. Consider this; that the classical conservative philosophers of the US and the original political dissidents of Europe and Russia that formulated a working theory of Anarchy (beyond the Greek's origin) agreed on some very universal concepts: that the sole and total sum of the State was that it held the absolute monopoly over the use of violence in the geography it claimed control over.\n\nPonder that for a moment; every claim for legitimacy throughout human empire is predicated by and based upon the central theme of being the sole dispensary of violence throughout the region of rule. To simplify: authority is the force behind punishment; the validation of violence by the state or it's agents (regardless of what semantic gymnastics the organization attempts).\n\nSo then, what is the opposite of force? What is the opposite of violence and authority, the ability of authority to say 'Do as I command, or you will have violence visited upon you'. Whatever apologetics you might endeavour to excuse the particular idiosyncrasies of some manifestation of the state and authority you personally agree with, in the end the driving force of control falls upon the same rule: violence against those who will not obey.\n\nSo, what is it that Anarchism espouses, if we know that violence is certainly the foundation of authority and it's central tool? \n\nI know the answer, and I have faith that given time, you will too.","score":28,"retrieved_on":1426548391,"subreddit":"AskReddit","downs":0,"created_utc":"1288683106","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","controversiality":0,"name":"t1_c146ktk","author_flair_text":null,"author":"cat_mech","author_flair_css_class":null}
